N/A - Making Silicon Valley

1 Man: For thousands of years guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.
But now, for the first time, we are living in an era where we can be the vikings of our day.
Are you going to help me with this or not? You turned down $10 million to be able to develop something you can't even describe to another human being.
I say this only to motivate you.
Oh man, look at this place.
Save your childishness.
There's 40 billion of net worth walking around this party.
Cut.
I was interested in doing a show about Silicon Valley because I lived there and worked there as an engineer.
The world's very interesting to me.
I just knew a lot of these types.
They always travel in groups of five, these programmers.
There's always a tall, skinny white guy.
Short, skinny Asian guy.
Fat guy with a ponytail.
Some guy with crazy facial hair.
And then an East Indian guy.
It's like they trade guys until they all have the right group.
You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.
Judge: Same kind of personalities now.
I think there's more money, which makes it more interesting.
We start out in the series as Richard & Co.
, or just co-nerds trying to figure it all out.
There's money flying all over Silicon Valley, but none of it ever seems to hit us.
Richard is a humble employee at Hooli and he doesn't like it.
He wants more.
Richard has been developing a music app, but buried in the heart of that music app is this kind of kernel of genius.
Do you even realize the impact that a compression this good could have on the world? This is game changing.
I'm prepared to give you $200,000.
Six hundred thousand for - ten percent of your company.
- Ten million! I will take a small piece but the company will belong to you, not Gavin Belson.
- Um, you know - Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.
Richard is lured by the notion of being in complete control of his own destiny and ends up going with the rock and roll Peter Gregory.
My first official purchase as CEO of Pied Piper.
That's not really our logo, is it? It looks like a guy sucking a dick and he's got another dick tucked behind his ear for later.
It's like a snack dick.
The show is basically a how-to in starting your own business and doing it the wrong way.
Doing it the wrong way.
We're terrible at it.
Erlich is a guy who he had this company Aviato.
Sold Aviato for a few million and was able to buy this house.
And now I've become kind of the smallest, most pathetic version of a venture capitalist.
He owns and administers the house that these guys all live in.
The Hacker Hostel.
Miller: I let people stay at the house for free, and then I own 10% of the company.
Gavin Belson likes Pied Piper.
I own 10% of Pied Piper.
You said it was a shitty idea.
It was a shitty idea.
I'm not sure what it is now.
He's a talker and he's charming, so he can smoothly talk his way into pretty much any situation, including on-stage during a Flo Rida concert.
Look at Erlich.
See, that's what I wish I had.
It's like I don't have any, um Game.
Game.
Yes! That's it.
Gilfoyle, in a way, is kind of a quintessential programmer type.
He's a satanist.
Which is basically just he likes to party and have fun.
Sin is a thing of beauty.
What's with the cross? It's an upside down cross.
Not from here it isn't.
We have a rivalry, so we're arguing about who the better programmer is.
I just want to say that I feel I should get more equity than Dinesh.
Whatever equity I get, it should reflect that I contribute more than Gilfoyle.
Big Head is Richard's best friend.
Man: He's sort of a happy go lucky kind of hapless person who freely admits that he's not as good at coding as Richard.
What if Big Head is sort of like, uh, a floating utility player? Kind of like a Jack of all trades.
But by his own admission he's really more like a master of none.
That's true.
That is true.
When Richard is sort of taking ownership of this company, he needs to let Big Head know that Big Head is really non-essential personnel.
So this is goodbye then.
It's one of the first kind of difficult choices that Richard has to make as the CEO of this new company.
Gavin Belson just offered me a job for 600 grand a year.
What? Yeah, for revenge.
So you're like, the VP of spite? I play Gavin Belson who is the CEO and founder of Hooli.
He wants to buy and crush Richard Hendricks.
I hate Richard Hendricks, that little Pied Piper prick.
Is that wrong? Gavin is sort of in the mold of one of these guys who has accomplished so much, they think they can do anything.
He's the least cool guy I've ever met.
Jared's a guy who's second in command to Gavin Belson, and he defects from Hooli to join this pirate ship of young tech guys.
Hey.
Sorry if I scared you.
I know I have some like ghost-like features.
My uncle used to say, "you look like someone starved a virgin to death.
" Jared just happily takes the shape of whatever shoe is pressing down on him.
His strength would be his meticulousness and his material feelings.
From rules based filtering we go to workflow.
At which point that card is moved from the icebox into the in progress column and it stays there until it is ready for testing.
And that, gentlemen, is scrum.
This just became a job.
Gavin Belson is spurned by Richard in favour of Peter Gregory who promises Richard he will help Richard find his way.
Man: He's this weirdo, eccentric billionaire who can't talk to people, and yet has that vision that can see just beyond the horizon.
(Gagging) Hi.
Monica.
I work with Peter Gregory.
My character is kind of the right hand woman for Peter Gregory.
She's independent, she's strong, and she holds her own in this world that is dominated by men.
She's part of the 2% women that there are in the tech world.
Crew: I was a little nervous working with all of these amazing comedians.
They've been nothing but so welcoming and sweet to me, and I feel like I'm one of the guys.
Grow a pair and talk to her.
Find out for sure.
Why don't you grow a pair and I'll talk to her.
Judge: The cast in this is really great.
Man: These guys are all young, really talented improv comedy guys.
They're really good at playing off each other.
We just kind of wrote to that.
One of the cools things about the show is that we all knew each other in some capacity.
In real life we're very similar.
Miller: I mean, they're actually legitimate nerds.
I don't know.
Are you similar? No.
(Laughs) Miller: In real life I'm kind of the least nerdy guy.
I think I'm the only person that's been in a fight.
Many times Mr.
Michael Judge will see what we're doing, which is like, playing video games or playing some other obscenely nerdy thing and he'll just go, "huh.
Man, art imitates life.
" He's super annoying because not only is he like, obviously a comic genius, he's also like, a sick upright bassist.
The one thing I did remark when I first met him is he's handsome.
He's got a strong jaw line.
He has really beautiful eyes.
Oh yeah.
Handsome fella.
He's going to see this.
It's going to be weird.
Miller: He sounds exactly like butt-head from Beavis and Butt-head.
I don't know if he knows the guy or he used to watch that growing up a lot or what.
Well, Mike Judge does have actual street cred as an engineering nerd.
I never really knew the distinction between nerds and geeks, and it's changed over the years.
People nerd out on what is defined as nerd versus geek.
Geeks to me are so they kind of geek out on certain stuff.
Geek is like, a guy who like, has adult braces and gets in your not there's anything wrong with adult braces, but like, I feel like he has like, elective adult braces.
Geeks obviously have some sort of traumatic past Big Head's a nerd.
Gilfoyle's the geek.
Dinesh is a nerd.
Uh, and Erlich is a drug addict.
Erlich: I'm making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Sir! Are you okay in there? There are these kind of characters who if they were born 300 years ago, would not be the richest people in the world.
And now you have these guys with billions of dollars and they're still the same kind of socially awkward types.
They just don't quite know how to have fun with it.
That is a narrow car.
Fucking billionaires.
It's the Hollywood of tech.
Whooo! Man: What a dick.
It's weird.
It's like it's not enough that they're making billions of dollars, they also have to be always talking about how they're making the world a better place.
You know, we're making a lot of money.
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.
But most importantly we're making the world a better place through constructing elegant class hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility.
Yeah! You do not have to know anything about tech to get the humour of the show.
When our guys are talking about tech, we try and always attach it to some sort of an emotion where even if you don't understand what they're saying, you understand the thought behind it.
O'Keeffe: Mike and Alec Berg really pulled out all the stops with multiple researchers and consultants to make sure that this all reflects the reality of the world we're trying to portray.
Because, you know, we really, really want to get it right.
I think we have.
At some point I want to make sure it's all accurate and real and then after that it probably just goes in one ear and out the other for me.
What we've recreated in the other room is an exact replica of a real conference, TechCrunch Disrupt.
It's a bunch of venders or a bunch of start-up companies that all come together and they pitch their wares in the hopes of winning TechCrunch.
Crew: They have to present their app, and fingers crossed it works.
And if it does, it's game changing for all of them.
And if it doesn't, they're screwed.
We learned about all these companies.
We learned about what TechCrunch was and in very many ways we really learned a lot about the depth of the tech industry.
We've recruited a lot of the companies that were actually present at the real TechCrunch.
So a lot of the companies that have booths here, they're kind of peddling their wares, are real companies.
So many companies.
So many names.
Any combination of letters are already taken.
What about smaller? Because then that's an even smaller version of the word smaller.
So that it looks like smiler.
We're not going to kick the shit out of nucleus with smiler.
Kwerpy.
Yeah, there's a kwerpy.
You gotta spell it with a "k".
You can't clear anything.
The name defines the company.
It has to be something primal.
Something that you can scream out during intercourse.
Pied Piper! Ugh.
Ross: I think Silicon Valley, the show, is very much about making your way in the world and the choices you make, presented in a comedic fashion, but under the very intense fire of everything that's happening in Silicon Valley right now.
It's just cool to see, you know, what that breathes in people when like, literally from one day to the next you could become a multi, multi millionaire.
O'Keeffe: But it's in a world that I don't think people have seen a lot of on television, so it's interesting.
What Mike and Alec have really brought to this is a relatability of guys and friendship and sort of normal people, but set in this world with these heightened stakes, and that part of it is universal.


******************************************
N/A - Minimum Viable Product

Whoo.
Yeah.
Somebody make some motherfucking noise in here! Fuck these people.
Man, this place is unbelievable.
Fucking Goolybib, man.
Those guys build a mediocre piece of software, that might be worth something someday, and now they live here.
There's money flying all over Silicon Valley but none of it ever seems to hit us.
What the hell are you eating? Liquid shrimp.
It's 200 dollars a quart.
Wylie Dufresne made it.
How does it taste? Like how I would imagine cum tastes.
You guys taking it all in? Because this is what it looks like when Google acquires your company for over 200 million dollars.
Look Dustin Moskovitz.
Elon Musk.
Eric Schmidt.
Whatever the fuck the guy's name is who created Photrio.
I mean, Kid Rock is the poorest person here.
Apart from you guys.
Ok, there's 40 billion dollars of net worth, walking around this party.
And you guys are standing around drinking shrimp and talking about what cum tastes like.
Yeah, I heard that.
You guys live in my Incubator you've got to network.
That's why I brought you here.
I got us in here.
Javeed over there is my ex-room-mate.
Yeah, but I drove.
Eric Schmidt, Erlich Bachman.
It's amazing how the men and women at these things always separate like this.
Yeah, every party in Silicon Valley ends up like a hasidic wedding.
Not even the Goolybib guys were talking to girls.
They don't have to, Big Head.
This house talks to girls.
Hello! Whoo! I got seven words for you.
I love Goolybib's integrated- multi-platform-functionality! Yeah! Whoo! But seriously, you know, a few days ago, when we were sitting down with Barak Obama, I turned to these guys and said, "ok, you know, we're making a lot of money.
And yes, we're disrupting digital media.
But most importantly we're making the world a better place.
Through constructing elegant hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility.
" So everyone.
Here's to many more nights just like this one.
Take it away, my good friend, Kid Rock.
What a dick.
Big Head, there is a personal ad section on this asperger site.
Holy shit, this one is looking for a "relationship that has the potential to become sexual in nature.
" Boy, is she on the spectrum.
She can't even make eye contact with the camera.
Richard, can I talk to you for a second? - Solo.
- Mm-hmm.
We need to talk about Pied Piper.
What about it? The website's up and running, I'm just redesigning the compression.
It just needs users.
Yeah, no shit.
But even if somebody wanted to use it they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.
It's incomprehensible.
Now, Richard, when you pitched me Pied Piper you said it was gonna be, "the Google of music.
" Which is a really rad way to pitch something.
I mean, I liked it.
I thought it had "applications".
No, it has all that.
Look, when it blows up, and it will once it reaches a critical mass of users, Pied Piper will be able to search the whole world of recorded music to find out if there's a match to see if you're infringing on any copyrighted material.
So, if you're a song writer or a band Ok, first of all, nobody gives a shit about stealing other people's music, ok? Everybody involved in the music industry is either stealing it or sharing it.
They're all a bunch of assholes, especially Radiohead.
- Look, Richard - No.
Yeah, they're assholes.
Now, look, Richard, if you want to live here, you've got to deliver.
I can't have dead weight at my Incubator, ok? Either that, or show some promise for fuck's sake.
Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.
It gives you the location of a woman with erect nipples.
Now, that's something people want.
Richard, you need to get in touch with humanity.
When I sold my company, Aviato, I wanted to give back.
That's why I started this place, to do something big.
To make a difference.
You know, like Steve.
Uh, Jobs or Wozniak? Steve Jobs or Steve Oh, I heard you.
- Which one? - Jobs.
I mean, Jobs was a poser.
He didn't even write code.
You just disappeared up your own asshole.
- You know that? You did.
- Well, technically Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.
He knew how to package the ideas, but it was Wozniak that What is Hooli? Excellent question.
Hooli isn't just another high tech company.
Hooli isn't just about software.
Hooli.
Hooli is about people.
Hooli is about innovative technology that makes a difference, transforming the world as we know it.
Making the world a better place, through minimal message oriented transport layers.
I firmly believe we can only achieve greatness if first we achieve goodness.
Erlich is gonna kick me out.
And I can't afford to pay rent here.
It's insane.
$2800 a month, $4500 a month With five people.
Jesus! Why is it so expensive here? Look at this place, it's a shithole.
Uh-oh.
Here's another one.
Miss Palo Alto, 2K14.
There she goes.
Oh God, the marketing team is having another bike meeting.
Douchebags.
Yup, another day inside the Gavin Belson cult compound.
Hey, did you hear what Peter Gregory is doing? You mean buying that island in the Pacific? No, he's building one actually.
Baller.
Anyway, he's also offering a hundred k to people willing to skip or drop out of college to pursue their idea.
I don't know what happened to that guy, but he really hates college.
Anyway, he's doing a TED talks in Palo Alto tonight.
- We should try to get in.
- I dropped out of college.
Maybe I should re-enroll and drop out again.
Try and get the money.
Brogrammers.
Oh, no, no.
Hey, uh, a double macchiato for me, dude.
Yeah.
Hey, Rico, you been working out? No.
No, I have not.
I don't have time to even if I wanted to.
I'm too busy working on my website.
Uh, I just, I don't want to end up being a Hooli lifer.
You know, working here forever.
Yeah, working for the most innovative company in the world, with top pay and vested stock options.
I can totally see why you wouldn't want that.
Yeah, you're like an artist.
An entrepreneur.
An iconoclast.
I don't know, maybe.
Dude, we're just messing with you.
But we really want to help you with your site.
What's it called? Pied Piper.
- Dude, sounds amazing.
- Yeah.
Why don't you shoot it over to us and we'll give it a look.
Maybe we can help.
- Uh, really? - Yeah.
Ok, yeah.
I mean it's always good to have more eyes on it.
It's sent it.
Oh, you're making fun of me.
- Dude, no.
- No, you are.
- Aw, Ricky, man.
- Ricky.
Ricky, come back.
It's actually Richard, so that's - Pied wiper.
- Wide diaper.
Gates, Ellison, Jobs, Dell.
All dropped out of college.
Silicon Valley is the cradle of innovation because of drop outs.
College has become a cruel expensive joke on the poor and the middle class that benefits only the perpetrators of it.
- The bloated administrators.
- You are a dangerous man, spewing ignorance! I don't think so.
I'm just saying people should trust themselves more than a system that happily churns out unemployed debtors and provides dubious value.
The true value of a college education is intangible.
The true value of snake-oil is intangible as well.
Fascist.
Anything? The usual riffs on twitter and instagram.
Nothing I'd fund.
Hi, excuse me, Mr.
Gregory? I have an idea I'd love to pitch you, if you have time.
Oh.
Well, that is before I just give up and go back to college.
Don't! Do not do that.
Go work at Burger King.
Go into the woods and forage for nuts and berries.
Do not go back to college! I think I have been played.
Fine.
Go ahead and pitch.
You have until I fasten the seat-belt in my car.
Thank you so much.
Pied Piper is a proprietary site that lets you find out if your music is infringing on any existing copyrights.
So, imagine you were a song writer, ok? I don't think I could write a song.
Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.
I don't even think I could say, "Pied Piper is a proprietary site.
" Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.
Crunching all those songs to find matches sounds like it would take incredible processing power.
- I mean - Yes.
Yes, it does.
No, no.
Its I made an algorithm.
Look, why don't you send me a link to your project and we'll take a look.
Ok, yeah, great.
I put the prototype up on github.
Pied Piper.
I'll look it up.
It's like the fable with the kids and then the rats and the music.
That is a narrow car.
Fucking billionaires.
Hey, wanna check out twig-boy's website? Yes, I do.
You have to download your own media player? Ahh.
Look at me, I traveled back to 2009.
Wait a sec.
What is this file size? Wow, that doesn't sound at all downgraded.
The file size is like, half.
And look how fast this search is.
Holy shit, how did it find a match that fast? It's like it's searching compressed files? No way.
Look at that weissman score.
Hey, where have you two been? We're playing the multi-channel router team in five minutes.
Ok, how the hell did he do this? And the compression is totally lossless.
And he's somehow figured out a way to do a search on a compressed data space.
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.
And I don't think he even realizes what he has here.
He's using it for some silly songwriter app.
All these guys are like that, they're all about consumer facing.
Right, but you take something like this, make it business facing and use it for enterprise? The applications could be endless.
Hey, I thought you were a satanist? I'm a LaVeyan Satanist with some theistic tendencies.
Oh, some theistic tendencies.
Well then, what's with the cross? It's an upside down cross.
Not from here it isn't.
Oh, I see, you know what you should do? You should get another tattoo that says, "this side up" on it.
How does this translate into Farsi? That's not the language I speak.
Frontier Airlines just happened to like mine, Aviato.
And that's how I got to where I am.
So what do you got? Ok, here it is.
Bit Soup.
It's like alphabet soup but it's ones and zeros instead of the letters.
'Cause it's binary.
You know, binary is just ones and zeroes.
Yeah, I know what binary is.
Jesus Christ! I memorized the hexadecimal times tables when I was 14 writing machine code! Ok.
Ask me what nine times f is.
It's fleventyfive.
I do not need you telling me what binary is, just like I don't need you thinking about soup or taking pictures of it.
I need you thinking about apps, software, websites.
This is Silicon Valley, all right, not Paris, Texas.
That's where Campbell's soup is.
It's the Hooli number again.
It's probably those brogrammers.
Can't wait to tell me how stupid my website is.
Assholes.
Hello, Richard Hendricks.
I'm a total fucking retard.
Uh.
Hi, this is Jared Dunn calling from Hooli.
I'm calling a behalf of Gavin Belson.
I didn't hi.
Gavin is very excited about your Pied Piper application and we were wondering if you could come in for a sit-down with us.
- Are you available now.
- Ok.
- Sure.
Yes.
- Ok, we'll be here.
Good-bye.
Uh, I have a meeting with Gavin Belson.
He likes Pied Piper.
- Holy shit.
- I own 10 percent of Pied Piper.
You said it was a shitty idea.
It was a shitty idea.
I'm not sure what it is now.
- What time's the meeting? - Right now.
I'm gonna need a better shirt.
Holy shit.
What the fuck am I waiting for? See ya.
Well, it's like Gavin always says, "it takes change to make change.
" Yeah, I think I've seen that written around.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Gavin is running 30 minutes late but you should know he is very excited to see you, Richard.
He's with his spiritual advisor.
He shouldn't be that much longer.
I'm a VP here and I only get to see him about ten minutes a month.
But that 10 minutes is just incredible.
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.
Have you ever met Gavin before? - No.
- No? Oh, I told him, it's amazing.
That hardly begins to describe it.
It's weird.
They always travel in groups of five.
These programmers, there's always a tall skinny white guy, short skinny Asian guy, fat guy with a ponytail, some guy with crazy facial hair and then an East Indian guy.
It's like they trade guys until they all have the right group.
You clearly have a great understanding of humanity.
And Gavin said I'm not humiliating you, I'm elevating you.
Ah, Gavin.
This is Richard.
It's Peter Gregory.
Ah, no.
Come on, Big Head.
Yeah, I'm coming.
Slow Why are you going that fast? We've got a meeting with Gavin Belson.
Pick up the pace.
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's office right now, Mr.
Gregory.
Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back in So, Richard Hendricks is here! There you are, Richard.
So sorry these gentleman have kept you waiting.
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.
I love what you did.
- Really? - Fill him in, Jared.
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly the most progressive company in the world.
Part of that is Gavin's commitment to social justice, but part of it is his personal commitment to the people that work at Hooli.
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to give you a very substantial raise And a promotion to go with it.
I own 10 percent.
He created it while living in my Incubator.
Erlich Bachman.
This is Big Head.
I don't know what any of that means, but I'll give you six hundred thousand dollars for it.
We have the reach and the resources to take what you have done and push it to the global level.
That is a generous offer.
Shit, sorry.
Hello.
Really? No shit, that's Uh, yeah, yeah.
No here.
It's Peter Gregory.
Not sure how he got my number? Uh, this is Richard.
I'll give you three million dollars for it right now! Ah, Gavin Belson just offered me three million dollars for Pied Piper.
I'm prepared to give you three hundred thousand dollars.
Peter Gregory just offered me 300, um Did you say thousand dollars? For ten percent of your company.
Ok, four million.
- For five percent.
- Huh? You just went down.
No, you're still valued at four million dollars.
But you own ninety-five percent of a potential billion-dollar company.
And not just that, I will help you build this company.
I will introduce you to the people you need to know and provide the counsel that you need.
I will take a small piece, but the company will belong to you.
Not Gavin Belson.
You have until tomorrow to decide.
Ah, ok.
- Um, you know.
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.
I'm offering you four million dollars right now.
I'm That is a lot of money.
You know, I actually have to I've got to go to the bathroom.
I've got to pee.
It's desperate.
I'm bursting.
I'll be right back, but right now Ok, 10 million.
No.
Maybe.
I didn't mean to snap at you.
I'll talk in a bit.
Won't be long.
Little more about me.
I am the founder of Aviato.
And I own a very small percentage of Grindr.
It's a men to men dating site where you can find other men within 10 miles of you.
Interested in having sexual intercourse in a public restroom.
In the homosexual community there's sometimes anonymous I know what Grindr is.
I have gay friends.
So you will survive.
It's just a garden variety panic attack.
Welcome to Silicon Valley.
We see people like you all the time.
- Really? - Yes.
It's just I have to make this decision by tomorrow.
Yeah.
You know, a while back, we had a guy in here in almost the exact same situation, "take the money or keep the company.
" What happened? Well, a couple months later he was brought into the ER with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
I guess he really regretted not taking that money.
He shot himself because he turned down the money? Yeah.
Or no, he took the money.
Or no.
No, he did not.
I don't You know what? I don't remember.
But whatever it was, he regretted it so much that he ended up shooting himself.
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind? Yeah, just fyi, if you're ever gonna shoot yourself, don't hold the gun up to your temple, ok? Because that just basically just took out both of his optic nerves and then, you know, half of his face.
And then his wife left him, because, you know.
- Yikes.
- Right.
He may have been a genius programmer but not so much in human anatomy.
Or decision making, for that matter.
Now he's got to live with all that and whatever terrible decision he made about the money.
Uh.
And what do I do if I feel another panic attack coming on.
Would you be interested in a device that links up to your smartphone and it keeps track of your vitals and it tells you, even before it's happening, whether you're having a panic attack or an actual heart attack? Yeah, that sounds great.
You would, right? Ok, that's great news.
Because it's still in prototype phase right now, but my start-up partners and I are looking for investors.
Like today.
So will you please let me know I'm going to give you my number.
If you do end up taking that 10 million dollars because we could really make the world a better place.
Whoa! Oh, jeez! Richard.
Hi, Monica.
I work with Peter Gregory.
- We met outside the TED - Yeah, I remember you.
What how'd you know I was here? Peter Gregory is invested in a company that uses GPS in phones to track people.
That's creepy.
You don't know the half of it.
And neither does congress.
- Are you ok? - Look, I don't want to waste your time.
I think I gotta take the money from Gavin Belson.
At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out I'll have some money left for my family.
Jesus.
Sorry.
That is a terrible doctor in there.
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours is a compression algorithm that blew our engineering team away.
And what do you think Hooli is going to do with it? I don't know.
That's their business.
This is your baby.
Do you even realize the impact that a compression this good could have on the world? Getting any file on your mobile phone in an instant.
Navigation data for self-driving cars, mobile medical imagery, all transmitting with no quality loss.
This is game-changing.
Don't you want to be in the driver's seat when that happens? You really want to just turn it all over to Hooli and walk away? Well, you are not making this easier for me.
I'm not trying to.
I mean you're actually making it worse.
My hands are tingling.
I have this metal taste in my mouth.
Actually, I can't go back in there, so I'm going to go home.
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.
Uh, ok.
Thanks.
Dude, where have you been? Why won't you answer your phone? Man, this has grown way beyond angellist.
Andreesen, elevation and like a bunch of other seed funds are piling onto this thing.
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.
He's out of control.
Yeah.
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200k and built our own company? I'm sorry.
You said we.
Who's that in reference to exactly? You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.
I mean, right now Pied Piper just does audio, but I'm thinking of ways to compress images, video I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.
Maybe this could be huge.
Look, guys, for thousands of years guys like us have gotten the shit kicked out of us.
But now, for the first time, we are living in an era where we can be in charge and build empires.
We could be the vikings of our day.
- Vikings? - How are you feeling? You look super fucked up to be honest.
Who ate my fucking quinoa again? So you're really about to go tell Erlich that he's not going to get his one million dollars? Yeah, I don't want to be there when you do that.
I would like to be there when you do that.
No, just stay here, please.
Hey.
Um, so, I've been thinking about this whole Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.
And, um, I think I'm going to go with Peter Gregory.
- Uh, which I know means - Richard.
I know that you look at me, and see a guy who has it all figured out.
And for the most part, you're right, I do.
When I sold Aviato, it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes, the universal respect of all the ladies.
But there's always been a hole in my heart.
Not a literal hole like you would find in some babies with congenital diseases, but a metaphorical hole.
I guess that hole is the "what if".
What if I didn't sell? I'll never know.
And so I guess what I'm saying to you now is, you're like me, Richard.
You want to build something and see it through.
So, just to be clear.
You're all right with me saying no to a deal that will net you a million dollars outright? No, Richard.
I'm not all right with it.
I'm excited about it.
Let's see how high this rocket can fly, partner.
Ok.
Great.
That's great.
Not partners, exactly.
But everything else is great.
Call it what you want.
Always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue, always Oh! That was a yellow.
What was that, 17? - Pretty good.
- Hey, guys Guys, can I just kind of say something real quick? I know it's stupid but, um I just want to say, uh, I'd like for this company to be different than Hooli and Goolybib and all the rest, you know? Like, let's like not turn this into a corporate cult with bike meetings and voluntary retreats that are actually mandatory.
And claiming to make the world a better place all the time.
Let's, uh, let's just think different.
Don't think different.
That's Apple.
Uh, umm Let's just Let's just do it.
- That's Nike, man.
- I know that's nike.
- Yeah.
- Uh Fuck it.
I don't know.
Let's just make it Let's just make it happen.
Yeah, agreed.
To his beneficence.
Peter Gregory? - The Dark Lord.
- Of course, The Dark Lord.
Big Head.
God, he's worse high.
Always blue, always blue, always blue, always blue

N/A - The Cap Table

Holy shit.
- Uh - What the fuck is that? Uh, that is Jared Dunn.
He works for Gavin Belson.
Hey.
Sorry if I scared you.
I know I have somewhat ghost-like features.
My Uncle used to say, "You look like someone starved a virgin to death.
" It's yeah.
I can see it.
I heard you were having a launch party.
- Yeah.
- Am I early? No.
Well then, a gift of congratulations.
Now, if Gavin sent you here, you should know that I've turned him down.
I'm going with Peter Gregory.
I'm actually picking up my check tomorrow.
So I've made my decision.
That's not why I'm here.
It's just Watching you say no to ten million dollars to build your own thing, there's just something very exciting about that.
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa! What is he doing here? Hey, this is a private party, buddy.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Oh, I didn't mean to - You know, in the state of California you can kill a man for entering your house without permission.
Ok.
I understand.
Uh, thank you.
Richard, I just wanna say, I really respect what you're doing here.
And if you could ever use someone with my business development skill set, I would love to be a part of this.
The fuck you will be.
We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.
You know this is a fucking domestic? Why why were you so mean to him? He wasn't spying on us.
He just said he likes us.
- He wants to join the company.
- Of course he does, Richard.
Let me explain something to you.
Your whole life you've been an ugly chick but now suddenly you're a hot chick, with big tits and small nipples.
So guys like that are gonna keep coming around.
Don't be a slut, Richard.
I don't Now speaking of such things, Dinesh, change the lighting to something erotic because it's about to get pretty fucking erotic in here.
License to kill-9.
IB action-dot-erotica.
Wha what What's going on? - What's happening? - Gentlemen, I present to you Mochacino.
Not this guy.
Mochacino.
She's my gift to you.
You wanna smoke weed? Hey.
Can somebody play something with a beat, please? I'll go make a playlist.
Yeah.
I actually have some some water, uh, cooking, I think.
Yeah, I don't pay for it.
So Barking up the wrong tree here.
God, I hate Palo Alto.
Hello again.
You know, I don't actually have a ton of dance music but I turned the bass way up.
Baby you're getting a private show.
Hey.
What the fuck? Ok.
There's the butt time.
Hey, should we have left him in there by himself? I mean, should we go back in there? No interest.
I entice the flesh, I don't pay for it.
Plus, Tara's coming into town in a couple weeks.
I'm saving up all my humors for her.
You know what I mean? - What's your excuse? - I didn't even shake a woman's hand until I was 17-years-old.
The idea of getting an erection around men I live and work with, it's just not something I can handle.
The idea that I have a boner and you have a boner and he has a boner and we're all sitting there with boners in our pants I wonder if he's ok in there.
So what do you guys do here? Oh, we're mostly working on a lossless compression algorithm.
- A what? - It makes files smaller.
Doesn't matter.
Uh, it's called Pied Piper.
It's gonna be famous.
You'll know it, eventually.
Who was this woman that you shook hands with for the first time? The postman lady.
- What? - A woman that was a man? Not a post-man lady.
- A lady who was a post - Let me ask you another question.
Who was the second woman you shook hands with? I didn't even know you were coming.
- Stop.
Doug! - Oh, boy.
- Stop.
- I don't think I'm the one Someone is paying me.
Ok.
I didn't come just to dance on your boner all night for free.
I was not erect.
I that was I was only being polite.
So you were being polite when you said that you loved me? First off, I said you seemed like someone I could fall in love with.
And, yes, also politeness.
Richie, pay the lady.
What? Why Why should I pay her? I didn't hire her.
I didn't even get a lap dance.
This is a company party and you're the CEO.
- So pony up.
- No.
If anyone should pay her it should be you.
Doug, help the CEO find his money.
No.
No, no.
We don't I don't need help.
I know where it is.
It's here.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's all here.
Do you I don't know Do you accept amex? - You damn right I do.
- Put a hundred on there for yourself, Mocha.
- Well, that's an expensive boner.
- Not a boner.
Thanks for coming in, guys.
We have a lot to do, so, let's get started.
Sounds great.
Me? Ok.
Uhh Well, we're just really excited to get going, Mr.
Gregory.
Yes.
Who's "we"? Myself, him, uh, - the guys back at the house.
- Guys? What guys? Who is this? Erlich Bachman.
I'm an entrepreneur, much like yourself.
Uh Richard actually developed Pied Piper while residing in my Incubator, so as per our agreement, I own ten percent of the company.
I'm paying you $200,000 for five percent yet you're giving this man twice that in exchange for a futon? And some sandwiches? Actually, sir, my tenants provide their own food What other percentages have you apportioned? Can I see your cap table, investment deck, business plan or any other relevant paperwork you may have prepared? I I just was under the impression that, uh we would just be coming by and saying "hi", you know, uh, to pick up the check.
And, uh, I just didn't know that any of that stuff was due yet.
"Due"? This is not college, Richard.
I am not going to be giving you a course syllabus.
You turned down ten million dollars to keep Pied Piper.
What did you give up that money for? What is this company? What did I buy? - You bought the algorithm, which - No.
The algorithm is the product of the company.
I know that.
What I'm asking about is the company itself.
Who is it? What do they do? Are they essential? Or do you just throw a percentage at them like you did with this This all must be worked out.
Now.
When you said you'd guide us through some of the stuff I thought that this was the stuff you'd be guiding us through.
I cannot guide you until you give me something to guide.
This is going very poorly.
I know that.
He doesn't seem to know what he's doing.
Did you just take a sip from an empty cup? Yes.
Why did you do that? - Just something to do.
- Come back in 48 hours with an airtight business plan, a clear go-to-market strategy and three year summary P&I or there will be no check.
That's it.
Well, thanks for coming in, guys.
Um are there any water fountains in your offices? I assume.
I own ten percent of an app that locates all nearby water fountains.
I'd be happy to discuss it with you.
Good day, gentlemen.
You smoke weed? You really embarrassed me in there.
You didn't say shit about any business plan before today.
And neither did he.
And he was kind of being an asshole back there.
Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire.
'Cause he knows how and when to be an asshole.
That's what you need to be like.
- You do, Richard.
- Whatever.
If you continue to mismanage this company giving ten percent to whoever Obviously, you know, we can't go back on my shares.
That ship has sailed but from here on out.
Now you're being an asshole.
You say that like it's a bad thing.
Richard, if you're not an asshole, it creates this kind of asshole vacuum and that void is filled by other assholes, like Jared.
I mean, you almost gave him shares.
You need to completely change who you are, Richard.
A complete teutonic shift has to happen.
Tectonic.
What? A "tectonic" shift is the earth's crust moving around.
"Teutonic", which is what you just said, is an ancient Germanic tribe that fought the Romans.
They were originally from Scandinavia Stop it! Stop it.
You're being a complete tool right now.
I need you to be a complete asshole.
Do you understand the difference? If you're not an asshole, this company dies.
Erlich, I have 48 hours.
Are you going to help me with this business plan or not? I believe in you, Richard.
That's why I'm not.
"Business plans that are created in support of new ventures are to implement profound changes in existing venture.
" Uh Hi, this is Richard Hendricks.
Is now a good time? Uh, I need some help.
Who's Chevy Volt is that out front? Uh, Jared Dunn's.
What? Why? Why is he here? Well, because as you know, I need some advice on the business plan.
- You're cutting him in? - Um Good morning.
Whoops, that was weird.
I don't know why I did that.
You kind of have a Like a king-ish feeling to you.
You're like a Like a Norse hero from Valhalla.
Don't pander to me.
Peter Gregory said specifically to trim the fat.
They actually tried to diagnose me with a wasting disease because of my slender frame.
So, um, I ironed out our customer acquisition strategy, and I wrapped our financials, I did a DCF valuation.
Most VC's can't even do that math, but something tells me Peter is different.
I think we can jump into the one-on-ones with each team member - to see if I can defend our cap table.
- Ok.
Um, but first, if you don't mind, I'd like to use the restroom.
Yeah.
You don't have to ask permission to do that.
Why, have you not gone since you've been here? I have not.
Well well, go.
I mean, go.
Denpok, I know you were in Aspen, thank you for coming.
Please, have a seat.
I'm not sitting this summer.
Of course.
Incredible.
What's weighing on you, Gavin? Jared Dunn quit today to join Pied Piper.
I hate Richard Hendricks, that little Pied Piper prick.
Is is that wrong? In the hands of a lesser person, perhaps.
But in the hands of the enlightened, hate can be a tool for great change.
You're right once again.
Audious, play John Lennon's "Imagine.
" Cueing, John Wayne in a mansion.
Not found.
- Fuck! Fuck! - Invalid command.
Use the anger, chela.
Use it.
Uh, thanks for sitting down like this, Gilfoyle.
We know it's kind of a little weird.
So, um can you kind of catch me up on what you see as your role in the company? What do you do? What do I do? System architecture.
Networking and security.
No one in this house can touch me on that.
Ok, that's good to know.
But does anyone appreciate that? While you were busy minoring in gender studies and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence, I was gaining root access to NSA servers.
I was one click away from starting a second Iranian revolution.
I actually went to Vassar.
I prevent cross-site scripting, I monitor for DDoS attacks, emergency database rollbacks, and faulty transaction handlings.
The Internet heard of it? Transfers half a petabyte of data every minute.
Do you have any idea how that happens? All those YouPorn ones and zeroes streaming directly to your shitty, little smart phone day after day? Every dipshit who shits his pants if he can't get the new dubstep Skrillex remix in under 12 seconds? It's not magic, it's talent and sweat.
People like me, ensuring your packets get delivered, un-sniffed.
So what do I do? I make sure that one bad config on one key component doesn't bankrupt the entire fucking company.
That's what the fuck I do.
That's basically what I told him.
Listen, wherever we end up here I just wanna say that I feel I should get more equity than Dinesh.
I know Gilfoyle probably came in here and puked out a bunch of tech specs, three-fourths of which are total horse-shit.
Did he bring up the Iranian revolution thing? Yeah, those words mean nothing.
I'm the only one of these clowns that can code in Java.
And I write sleek performant low-overhead scala code with higher order functions that will run on anything.
Period.
End of sentence.
So basically, I think whatever equity I get, it should reflect that I contribute more than Gilfoyle.
- This is weird.
- I know, right? It's - Everybody's been doing it.
- Gilfoyle did this? It's just a formality, to get me caught up.
So what makes you of value to the Pied Piper team? Um programming.
I guess pretty good at code, develop algorithms So forth.
Different from the type of algorithm Richard created? Well, yeah.
Like, not as good.
Richard's a 10x-er, I'm, like, barely an x-er.
I kinda suck.
Smoked you.
And now - Don't be a dick.
- Mushroom stamp! - You're being a dick.
- There you go.
Show that to your mom.
Mushroom stamp! That's great.
Hey, what do you guys think about this Jared? He's shit, right? No, he's pretty sharp.
Yeah, he does shit that no one else in the house can do.
Yeah, but he's a know it all.
I don't think there's room in here for him.
Well, there will be after Richard gets rid of Big Head.
Wait, Richard's getting rid of Big Head? Why? Listen, we all love Big Head.
But, the truth is he's not as good of a coder as I am, not as good at system architecture as Gilfoyle, not as good at being a prick as you, no offense.
He's a lightweight at everything.
Brings nothing to the table.
Him getting points would be a big "fuck you" to all of us.
- But he's a great guy.
- Great guy.
But useless.
Yeah, he is a great guy.
Not like that Jared.
At least we can all agree on that.
Yeah, I don't know.
Me and Richard have just always been in this together, you know? Together, right.
But to be clear, Richard created the algorithm on his own, yes? Oh, yeah, I had nothing to do with that.
- He's my best friend.
- That's true.
Yes.
The camaraderie is quite apparent.
But Peter Gregory demanded a lean, ruthless business plan.
And I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft has a paid best friend.
- Sergey Brin does.
Larry doesn't do shit.
- See? What if Big Head is sort of like a floating utility player? Like a jack of all trades.
But by his own admission, he's really more like a master of none.
That's true.
That is true.
Which is not something you'd generally reward with several points in what may some day be a multi-billion dollar company.
This will never fly with Peter Gregory.
I would not want to be Richard right now.
Having to tell Big Head that he's out.
This is gonna sound super mean, but the other night he was sleeping, I was just staring at his face.
All I could think was, "He's utterly useless.
" Big Head is a man with zero purpose.
- Oh, hi.
Hi, Big Head.
- Hey.
How's it going? It's super good Right now.
Um, I'm just going to maybe go for a bike ride real fast and clear my head.
I'll see you.
- Bike safe.
- Yeah, enjoy it.
That was nice, guys.
He heard everything.
That doesn't make it not true.
I mean, come on, Richard.
As far as Pied Piper is concerned, he's as pointless as Mass Effect 3's multiple endings.
I mean, he's a completely useless appendage and we all know it.
- Oh, hey, man.
- Forgot my water bottle.
Just gonna grab it, and then probably walk right back through one more time.
I mean, Mass Effect 3? Harsh.
I didn't mean for him to hear it but it was true.
I mean, we all called him a great guy but he didn't overhear any of that.
It's been 12 hours.
Goddamn.
He's still not answering.
I'm actually kind of worried about him.
You know, if he's gone, like, really truly gone, in a way that kind of solves your problem.
I mean, like, if he's dead Are you trying to say that Big Head might be dead? That doesn't help at all.
How is that helping? I'm just saying that that's a possible thing that could've happened to him.
It could happen to anybody.
And in this case, at least something good came out of it.
What's the good part? You don't have to have an awkward conversation.
That's scary.
Should we go look for him? I mean, I agree with these guys.
Jared's just not working out.
- What? - Um, Richard I, uh, don't wanna be too assertive here but I could use your input on a few things for the business plan.
Richie, you tried your best just call him, leave a message, say he's out.
No, that's an asshole move.
Yeah, remember? You need to be an asshole.
I feel bad about saying that thing about him being dead.
That's not who I am.
- Wait, what is that? - That's impossible.
NipAlert isn't live yet.
Maybe he's demoing it for someone.
"Mochacino.
" He rode his bike to San Jose? Jared, can I borrow your car? - Sure.
- I have a car.
What What's wrong with my car? I just have I don't know.
All right, well, remember to be an asshole.
A real asshole.
Hi, I'm Richard Hendricks.
You did a dance The dancing at my house.
Your ride's here.
Oh, hey, man.
- Hey.
- Mushroom stamp! No, come on, dude, not I just wanted to work with computers and get paid for it.
I didn't want end up fighting with my roommates over percentage points.
So you're just gonna give up? On what? This isn't home.
As much as I've tried, it's just not.
I mean, what would've I have even done if I didn't have Mochacino's card? Where would I have gone? It's fucking pathetic.
Well, Mochacino seemed to like you.
She let you into her apartment.
I had to give her my bike.
She's just like everyone else in this goddamn Valley.
Watching the bottom line.
Fuck it, dude.
I'm done here.
What about NipAlert? Mochacino shows her tits for a living and even she was uncomfortable using it.
She said it was sexist.
She's right.
It's actually perverted.
I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing.
And, you know, everybody's right, man, there's nothing for me to do on Pied Piper.
I think over time, maybe we could redefine your role.
Come on, dude.
Unless you can tell me right now what I can do for Pied Piper that no one else can, I'm gone.
Yeah.
I'm going to go get the stuff out of my cube at Hooli and then I'm getting the hell out of this town.
So this is goodbye then? I mean, I'll see you back at the house, man.
I gotta, like, pack and stuff.
Totally.
I'm going to take the train I think, just Do some thinking Ok, all right, see ya.
- The train is this way I just - Oh.
I was gonna say.
Big Head Whatever shit you're about to dump on my head, you can save it, ok? I'm not in the mood.
Dude, I just wanted to tell you that Gavin Belson wants to talk to you about something.
- Oh, ok.
Fuck you.
- No.
Seriously.
Gavin Belson said he wants to speak to Nelson Bighetti? Yeah, that's what I just said.
Come on.
Ok.
I'm awake! I'm awake.
- What? - No, no, I wasn't.
I was sleeping.
I'm sorry for sleeping and for lying about it.
For both.
No good.
What happened? Did you fire Big Head? Uh, no.
Not yet.
I don't know.
Sort of.
So do I include him in the cap table or not? It's basically good to go.
Uh no, he's out.
Uh, wait I don't know.
Actually, I just need to close my eyes for a little bit.
Ok? Richard, it's t-minus four hours until presentation time.
Are you gonna fire Big Head or not? I don't know.
Uh I'm just very tired.
Ok? I'm just gonna go get some water Richard, stop being a fucking pussy and start being an asshole.
Fine! You want me to be an asshole, I'll be an asshole.
I'll be an asshole to you and you and you and you and Peter-fucking-Gregory! Ok? Fuck all of you.
Big Head stays! You know, if I wanted to be a sell out I'd have done that already.
I'd be on a beach somewhere with ten million dollars in my pocket.
Not in my pocket, in a bank account.
Ok? This is my company.
It was my idea and we do what I say.
And what I say is, Jared, put Big Head in the business plan.
He gets the same amount of shares as everybody else.
Big Head, you're not going home, man.
You're right.
I'm not.
Gavin Belson just offered me a huge promotion for 600 grand a year to steal me away from you guys.
- What? - Yeah.
For revenge.
Because you took Jared.
So you're like the V.
P.
of spite? But you have to do me a favor, Richard, if you run into Gavin ever you have to act really upset about it, you know? Oh, but I am upset.
Ok? What the fuck? I kind of just went out on a limb for you here, man.
Sorry, man, but this is huge for me.
I'm going to move out, get my own place.
In light of this new information, who gets Big Head's equity? Should I get half of his shares? I do.
I get it.
Ok? I get all of it! Big Head, man, congratulations on the job, really.
But if you'll excuse me, I have to go lock down a motherfucking business plan.
Jared, you're with me.
- What an asshole.
- Yeah.
What an asshole.
Next.
- Hi.
Deposit? - Mmm-hmm.
Two hundred thousand dollars from Peter Gregory? Mmm-hmm.
Wow.
Sorry.
Hello? Dude, they're taking your code apart.
What? Did you give those brogrammer guys access to a player download or something? Oh shit.
They probably hacked the prototype and decompiled the compression library Well, they've got it now, man.
They're gonna reverse-engineer a version as close as they can without getting sued.
Wait, wait, are you sure about this? Yeah, dude, Gavin wants to beat you to market.
He wants to make sure no other investor in the Valley offers you a dime.
That is not good.
They're calling it Nucleus, whatever the fuck that means.
Shit.
Sorry, dude, I can't be talking to you like this.
Later.
Yeah.
"Nucleus"? Excuse me.
This check is made out to "Pied Piper Incorporated.
" Do you have an SS-4? A what? Is "Pied Piper" a corporation registered with the IRS? I can't deposit that into a personal account.
I don't know.
Um is that something maybe you could help me with? No, sir.
Buddy, come on.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.
- Sorry.
Ok.
Next.

Because if we can make your audio and video files smaller, we can make cancer smaller.

What an asshole.
Why would he announce it so far ahead of the actual rollout? No one does that.
He's got to be doing it just to fuck with us, right? I actually think we're ok.
The player I gave them was from a retired repository that was audio only.
Video compression is a completely different paradigm.
What they have is like Pied Piper, but not as good.
- People will see that.
- Not if they get to market before us.
Inferior products win out all the time.
Like Jesus over Satan.
I was going to say VHS over Beta.
Ok, well, actually this is a superior product, right here.
Is it a margarita machine? It's better.
My first official purchase as CEO of Pied Piper.
That's not really our logo is it? It looks like a guy sucking a dick and he's got another dick tucked behind his ear for later.

It does.
- No, it's it's Pied Pipe Here, put them on.

I don't want it.

So? So, it's made out to "Pied Piper Incorporated," I checked with the Secretary of State website, and there's already a "Pied Piper" operating in California.
So we need to change our name.
- Thank God! - Praise the dark lord, that's great news.
No, it's not great news.
We love the name Pied Piper.
It's a classic fairy tale.
Well, I looked it up.
It's about a predatory flautist who murders children in a cave.
It has all of that going for it, Richard, and I still hate it.
Richard, if we are going to change the name, we need to do it now.
Names stick.
My name's only Jared because Gavin called me that on my first day.
My real name is Donald.
But, Jared, we already bought the t-shirts.
I can't take these back.
It was an online order.
What is that atrocity? What are we, an Irish pornography company? I thought we were gonna replace the name "Pied Piper.
" I thought it was a Place Holder.
"PlaceHolder" would honestly be a better name than Pied Piper.
Richard, I've actually been holding off telling people I'm the co-founder of "Pied Piper" because frankly, it's a little embarrassing.
Well, um, just to remind you, you are not the co-founder.
So please don't tell anyone.
Richard, take Aviato.
That's not a name I found, it's a name that found me on a vision quest.
Something that you should do.
No, no.
I'm not gonna eat a bunch of drugs and sit out in the desert, and hope some name randomly pops in my head.
Well, then I question your leadership.
Richard, a name defines a company.
It has to be something primal, something that you can scream out during intercourse.
Like Aviato.
Uuuuber! Gooooogle! Huuuuuulu! Exactly, right.
Pied Piper! I'm so sorry.
Your voice doesn't really reach that register when you ejaculate, does it? No, it's just, everyone was doing it, I was just chiming in.
You guys, we can't change our name.
I can't go into Peter Gregory's office with a new name, and ask him to cut me a new check.
I mean, he's pulled funding from companies for a lot less.
Uh, the Pied Piper name and trademark are registered to a sprinkler company in Gilroy.
I guess you could head out there and talk to them.
- But they may refuse - Ok.
No, no, no.
I'll negotiate with them.
No offense, Richard, but you're not a strong negotiator.
- I'm a great negotiator, Dinesh.
- You're a terrible negotiator.
I'm a decent negotiator.
Just, so Oh, Peter, you're here.
Uh We were supposed to meet 40 minutes ago with the guys from Astraphile about the emergency capital injection.
As we discussed, our North Carolina plant went sideways.
So we need 15 million now or we'll have to shut down.
Have any of you ever eaten at "Burger King"? Yes Why? Well, I was just driven past one.
And while I know their market cap is seven billion dollars-plus, I realize I am unfamiliar with their offerings.
Ok, fine.
But what does that have to do Is it popular among your peers? Is it enjoyed? - People seem to like it.
- Yeah, it's ok.
And their selection consists solely of these burgers, of which they are presumably king? They have other things.
Chicken, fish.
I'm sorry.
What are we doing here? Here is what we will do.
Monica, have one of the assistants go to the nearest burger king location and purchase one of everything.
Hey, Dinesh.
Dinesh.
I'm on the phone with the bank and they say they need an extra form for your payroll, because of your visa? Visa? What visa? I'm a fucking us citizen.
I have Dinesh Chugtai here, and he's pretty irate because Oh, I see.
Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national citizen of Canada.
Ok, thank you.
You're Canadian? Your "borders" are merely a construct.
I prefer to think of myself as a citizen of the world.
Do you mind just sending them the form so they know you're here legally? Yes, I mind.
And also I may not be.
To wit, maybe you could make out my checks to cash? Or bitcoin.
I didn't know I was working with an illegal.
The irony.
Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.
What is it your business does again? Something to do with algebra? Uh algorithm, actually.
It's for compression.
Ultimately what we're trying to do is You remind me of my son.
He's got asperger's too.
Oh, no, I don't uh Probably all those pesticides they put on the crops.
Well, whatever it is your business does, I don't think it's going to interfere with my irrigation company here.
I'm thinking about getting in another line of work anyway.
All these foreigners coming over here, putting pieces of shit like that all over the good farmland around here.
All so people can sit around, stare at their phones all day.
Nobody jerks off to magazines any more.
Uh, well, actually, that is a server farm.
What we do, compression, would mean fewer of those, because we'd save a lot of memory space.
- Really? - Yeah.
Well, I'm all for that, believe me.
I'll tell you what.
You can have the name for a thousand dollars.
How's that sound? Uh, that sounds great! Yeah, cool.
Oh, tremors, too, huh? Just like my boy.
Go for Erlich.
This is Richard Hendricks, CEO of Pied Piper.
That's right.
You guys said I was a bad negotiator, but I closed it! We got a name.
Tell everyone you know.
Oh, all right.
You don't sound that impressed.
No, no, I am.
I just Now we're Pied Piper.
So, later.
Here you go.
You must drink a lot of margaritas huh? We will now.
I have a startup that just got funded so this is just kind of a gift for my guys to celebrate.
Hup Good luck with that.
You'll need, too, it when this town kicks you in the balls.
- Ok.
Sure.
- Let me get the door for you.
I had three startups, myself, and I couldn't get those sand hill road morons to fund any of them.
Cowards.
My last company was genius.
Have you ever been lost in a parking lot before? Uh What app would do is use existing AvL technology, right? So you'd type in the VIN number.
And if you car didn't have AvL capabilities you would just type in whatever section of the parking lot you were in, like P3, or ground seven.
So you just, you just write down what section of the parking lot you're in? Why do you need an app for that? So you can remember where you parked.
Right, uh, but why don't you just write it down on paper? Well, yeah.
But this is for your phone.
Ok, so it's just sorta like notepad? - Exactly! See? You get it.
- Yeah.
I get it.
Why can't all those fucking VCs? Pussies, man.
Oh, there we go, thanks.
This is which one? The BK double stacker.
Fascinating Peter, I know that you are incredibly busy with this.
But I made a personal promise to the Astraphile guys that none of their employees would lose their job, which will happen at midnight to Do you see this? The junior whopper? No, not the sandwich.
This seed Atop the breading.
Those are sesame seeds.
A high number of these breadings have sesame seeds on them.
Billions of breadings.
Sesame seeds.
They only grow in certain microclimates.
Peter, I know you don't want to cause a hundred and seventy three people in North Cicadas.
- Gentlemen! - Hey! It's our own personal Herb Cohen! - Who? - Herb Cohen.
He's a famous negotiator.
Wrote a bunch of textbooks.
- No? - What? Have you seen the blogs? No.
Erlich went ham on all the tech sites.
He hit TechCrunch, Recode, and PandoDaily.
Listen to what Kara swisher says.
"Individually", says Erlich Bachman, "We are formidable.
But when you combine our portfolios, Peter Gregory and I account for billions of dollars in assets.
We at Pied Piper look forward to giving Gavin Belson and the donkeys at Nucleus a run for their money.
" What a dick.
It's the guy with the name.
Hello, Arnold.
Cut the shit.
I just read Recode.
net.
You read Recode? I do when my customers tell me the name of my company's all over the Internet.
But you'd probably think I'm just out here shitting in a hole and wiping with my hand.
No, no, no, I don't think you do that.
Do people think you do that? Do you do that? No, no, no! I'm not falling for that phony, mumbley-mouth, googly-eyed routine again.
If you're this tech billionaire, why did I give you the name Pied Piper for next to nothing? You played me.
You want the name, it's going to cost you 250 grand.
Ok, I think you just need to talk to the guy who said all that.
And he can clear it up for you.
- Where's Erlich? - He's outside with the intern.
What intern? You got interns? We might as well have interns, we hire illegal aliens.
- What? - No, no.
We don't have either of those things.
I'll tell you what, asshole, you use the name Pied Piper again, I'm going to call my lawyer and we're gonna sue the shit out of you.
- Fucking billionaires.
- Arnold? Arnold, hello? - That sounded sub-optimal.
- Yeah, it was.
Hey, Jared, you know who else is Canadian? Justin Bieber, the Hitler of music.
Do you have a problem with me being Canadian? I do, actually.
Do you have any idea how long it took me to become a citizen? Did it take you a long time? I'm glad I didn't do it then.
Typical lazy immigrant.
These people think they can just walk into this country I did just walk into this country.
My car broke down on the ambassador bridge.
It took me an extra 15 minutes to get across the border.
Major hassle.
You know, Hitler actually played the bassoon.
So, technically, Hitler was the Hitler of music.
I don't understand.
I thought you closed the name.
Well, I guess it's still a little ajar, I don't know.
Who am I, Herb Cohen? - I don't know who that is.
- Neither do I.
That's a That's a Jared thing.
Hey! Make sure to clean off all the gunk off the front bumper, ok.
And since when do we have an intern program? We don't.
And when Keith finds that out, it's gonna be a valuable business lesson for him.
What? Those are the Pied Piper shirts! - Are you Richard? - Yeah.
Yes.
Ok, look, I fucked up.
What do we do now? Who's "we"? This morning you rudely reminded me that I wasn't a founder of this company and now you want me to hold your hand and help you out? I don't think so, sister.
This credit card is no good.
Declined.
Great.
Great.
That stupid margarita machine maxed me out.
So now the CEO of Pied Piper can't even afford to buy lunch.
Yeah, I don't think we can use that name anymore.
Dude! Dude, hey.
I owe you a big apology, man.
I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper! I met this dude! He came into the store and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!" I did? Yeah, so my mom was like, "Wow, really? You should really pursue it!" And I was like, "Yeah, I should.
" The parking app? So she decides to get a reverse mortgage on her home and write me a check.
- Ooh - So I'm funded! Because of you, man.
I was this close to giving up, and now you gave me my dream back, man! - But - Oh, hey, Ron! You see this guy? This billionaire here? He's the reason why I'm quitting! - Jamie, you don't - Well, you've helped me so much, what can I do for you? Well, I need to return this machine because I'm broke, and I need money for food.
Just a quick question.
Uh, is this gonna be a cash return, or does it credit back to the card? All right, what about Smaller, spelled "S-M-L-L-R"? You know, because we make things smaller, and this would be like a smaller version of the word "smaller".
- It looks like "Smeller".
- Ok.
What if we spell it "S-M-L-R"? Because that's an even smaller version of the word smaller.
Then it looks like "Smiler".
We're not gonna kick the shit out of "Nucleus" with "Smiler.
" Where's Richard? Why isn't he in here for this? I think he was out back, wishing he'd taken the ten million dollars.
No, I just saw him in his room, wishing he had taken the ten million dollars.
You know "smiler" is also something that guys call women's assholes.
Richard, why aren't you in there, coming up with new names? I don't want a new name.
I want Pied Piper.
But, apparently, I can't have that.
So now I have to come up with a new name and take that to Peter Gregory and ask for a new check he's gonna know pull our funding, Gavin Belson's going to crush us, and we will be ruined because I have no idea what I'm doing.
Neither did Zuckerberg when he was running Facebook at 19.
You think he had any real-world business experience? No.
None.
But he was such a tough negotiator that now all of his friends are suing him.
How awesome is that? And Steve Jobs? He took a shit-ton of hallucinogens.
What a coincidence.
Maybe something that you could actually do.
I'm not going on some fucking vision quest.
Ok, let me get this straight, you would rather do nothing than something? Because all the guys in the other room coming up with shitty names like, "Smallulator," are at least doing something.
Fine.
I'll just do it myself.
I'll be back in 24 to 72 hours.
Have a cold pitcher of water and some orange slices ready for me.
You know what, I'm really gonna go for this motherfucker so you better have some grapefruit ready, too.
I'm gonna come back with a name so amazing that Peter Gregory will write us ten checks.
What about, "Dwarfism 2.
0"? Where's "Dwarfism 1.
0"? Just in the world.
- Oh.
- That's prejudice.
- That's hurtful.
- I'm sorry.
Small, come back now, are you here? Interesting.
Hey! That is not cherry garcia.
Sorry, Gilfoyle.
Company business.
And who's hiding drugs? Shocker, it's the illegal immigrant.
What about mine-imize, like "minimize" but "mine".
Yeah.
Hello, Mr.
Garris.
Yes, this is Richard from the company that is rightly called Pied Piper.
That's right.
No, no, no.
You listen to me.
Ok.
We had a handshake deal.
And that may not mean a lot to you, but where I come from, that means a whole lot.
Ok, you agreed to sell me that name for a thousand dollars.
So let me ask you this? Are you an honest man or are you a goddamn liar? Ok.
Yes, same address? Good, yeah, great.
See you then.
Dude, that was fucking badass.
What did he say? He said he was gonna get in his truck, drive down here and beat the living shit out of me.
Why did you say that was your address? - Say any other address.
- I don't know.
He's got a very powerful voice.
What are we gonna do? If you keep screaming your name, it forces the assailant to acknowledge you as a human.
It is now 5:35pm and I have ingested the psilocybin.
I have started the countdown timer and I will be reaching Sonora and nirvana in approximately Oh, fuck.
Oh, shit.
He's here, that's him.
He came.
- Should I call 911? - No, that's a pussy move.
- Yeah, it's a pussy move.
- Shhh.
Just shush.
Just stay here until he goes away, please.
I'm looking for Pied Piper.
You know where it is? This is Pied Piper.
No, no, no.
It's a company.
Like a big, big office.
Do you know where that is? Yeah, this it.
Here.
Pied Piper.
No Uh Hi, Arnold.
I'm Richard.
I'm Richard.
I'm Richard.
- Donald.
I'm Donald.
- Richard.
Richard - Jared.
I'm Jared.
- Richard, Richard, Richard.
- Gilfoyle.
Gilfoyle.
- My name is Richard.
- Jared, Jared.
- Richard, Richard.
- Gilfoyle, Gilfoyle.
- Jing Yang.
Jing Yang.

Sysbit Digital Solutions.

Yeah.
TechBitData Solution Systems.
Creating unique cross platform technologies.
Technologies.
Technolo-Jesus.
Oh, fuck! So this is Pied Piper? This is a billion dollar company? Not even close.
Not yet.
You pack a lot of guys in here.
It reminds me when I started Pied Piper in my garage.
I kind of miss those days.
Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what.
Five thousand bucks and the name is yours.
Well, the thing is we agreed on a thousand.
Fine, four grand.
Look, that's not the deal.
- We shook on it.
- Two thousand.
Final offer.
We could do two.
That's reasonable.
No, we can't do two, Jared.
It's not reasonable at all.
Look, we shook hands on a thousand dollars.
That's the deal.
Ok.
A grand.
But you gotta throw in some gas money.
- I drove all the way out here.
- To come to kick my ass! Ok, you know what? Five hundred! That's the deal.
Five hundred.
- Fuck this.
- No, no, no, no.
We don't have to We can keep it at the original thousand dollars.
So, let's - Ok, you got a deal.
- All right.
Cool.
We got a name! Infotrode Cloud-based, disruptive platforms.
Disrupting the cloud through I said cloud twice, shit.
Making the world a better place through cross-platform business facing cloud There's that shit! There's that cloud again! Info-trode, Info-trode!? What the fuck is Info-trode? What is that? It's all just fucking meaningless words! Ok.
No, no, no Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Good-bye.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.
- Making the world a better place.
- Sir? Are you ok in there? - Making the world a better place.
- He's been in there all night.
I should call the sheriff.
Making the world a better place No, I hey, I told you he's going to handle it! - Mr.
Gregory, this is ridiculous.
- Sir Mr.
Gregory, we need an answer and we need it now! - Yes? - We need money.
Now.
And I'm sure that burger king and sesame seeds and whatever else you've been mumbling about in here all seem lovely to think about Myanmar and Brazil.
No, no! No more of this! Ok, are we getting the money or not? Will you please tell us what the hell is going on? Amusing coincidence that two of the three countries that provide the world's sesame seeds have such large cicada population, no? The cicadas of Myanmar emerge every 13 years, while the Brazilian cicadas emerge every 17.
Next year they will hatch, simultaneously, for the first time in 221 years.
Crops from both countries will be decimated.
Unlike Myanmar and Brazil, Indonesia has no cicada population.
I was surprised to see Indonesian sesame seed futures priced so low.
I made a purchase.
And now, if the shortage spikes the global price even ten percent.
We'll profit - Evan? - Sixty-eight million dollars.
If you wish, I could tap that projected revenue and make you a bridge loan of 15 million dollars, gentlemen.
Unless you need more? No, that's thank you.
Thank you, holy shit.
Yes? Happy? See? I told you he was taking care of it.
And now, would anyone like some BK? Evan was kind enough to go out and get breakfast.
It's just sitting here.
- Actually, we'd I'd love some.
- Thank you so much.
Is there cumin in this barbecue sauce? - I will definitely find out.
- Please do.
Gentlemen, we just got back from the bank.
Our first deposit slip.
We are officially Pied Piper.
And I am officially legal.
Dinesh wouldn't shut the hell up, so we finally went to the visa office.
Took me five minutes.
Took me five years.
They asked me about Al-Qaeda, like, 14 times.
He literally got it while I was still looking for parking.
- Hello.
- Is this Pied Piper? It is now, but we're not taking an follow-on investors at this point.
Investors? No, this is Kelsey from the ARCO Station out on 108.
Someone smeared your name and number in shit on my bathroom wall.
- Uh, I think you may have the wrong number - Richie.
Oh, hey, guys.
Uh, hi.
Who is this? You're not gonna believe this, but this is me.
Time is a sphere and I've been reincarnated during the same time period in which I exist.
Yes, but where he come from? From the future, obviously.
Also, from a parking lot at a gas station in Sonora.
He ate the whole bag of gold caps.
Awesome! Erlich So, should I call the cops now before anyone else does? I just got an AMBER Alert for Rogilio NuÃ±ez.
Yeah, ok.

urd.
Yeah.
Yeah, ok.
- So what are you going to say? - Fuck, I don't know.
Today's user wants access to all of their files from all their devices instantly.
That's why cloud-based is the holy grail.
Now Dropbox is winning, but when it comes to audio and video files, they might as well be called Dripbox.
Using our platform, Pied Piper users would be able to compress all their files to the point where they truly can access them instantly.
We control the pipe, they just use it.
That's the vision in Richard Hendricks' head.
Sure.
Sounds fine.
Oh, I received an email from Ron Laflamme saying that this gentleman is going to be our third board member? Uhh Yes.
Yes.
Uh, Erlich helped me with all this stuff.
He's very talented.
I need him as a partner.
Fine.
It's ok for you to leave now.
All right, ok.
Wait, is that you and Gavin Belson? Yes.
It's an old photograph.
Were you guys friends? I thought so.
Good-bye.
How'd it go? That was amazing.
I mean, that was like everything in my head but, like, clear.
Did you just make that up on the spot? Yeah.
We should probably write some of it down.
Yeah.
Well, look.
I gotta be honest, I mean, I can't tell you how much this means.
You really saved my ass even after I was such a dick to you.
- You're making up! - What else could I do, Richard? You're my Wozniak.
And I will always be Motherfu

N/A - Signaling Risk

It's a fucking sketchy neighborhood, man.
You see that guy? That's Chuy Ramirez.
And he's gonna do our new logo.
That's the artist you were talking about? You said he had paintings in galleries.
His works hang in the gallery of the streets.
- I'll be back in a flash.
- Whoa, no.
What? OK.
Man, we're just going to sit here like this? Oh, shit.
Look at this guy.
He's a scary individual.
- Whoa.
Um - Hey, buddy.
Do you have any drugs? Please, let it up.
Let it up.
If you don't let it go, I can't roll it up.
Just please Just, you Fucking prick! Ow! I'm gonna beat you in your face! Chuy Ramirez? Erlich Bachman.
- We spoke on the phone? - What's up, man? - Pleasure to meet you.
- All right.
This is great.
Look at this.
This is what we need, you know what I mean? Something raw.
We already have kind of a shitty name, Pied Piper, but the last thing we want is two lowercase P's in a square like those motherfuckers across the freeway would make.
This is what we want? So you gonna give me stock options, or what? - What? - Yeah.
You know Dave Cho? He did the murals over at Facebook.
He got a stock option deal, ended up making like a hundred million dollars.
I want a deal like that.
You know, I don't really speak all that Wall Street bullshit.
You know what I'm saying? We're just like five guys hanging out in a house, trying to make cool shit.
Well, you told me you own ten percent of it, so you must know something about it, right? You could just give me some of your points.
Hey, I'm not an accountant, you know? I don't even know what that means, a lot of those words.
You fucking prick! Oh, you fucker.
Let me in.
Please, please I'll break this.
I don't care.
I don't care.
- I'll break this - I can't hear you.
Oh God.
I can't hear you.
Yeah, but you don't want stock in our company.
If I could go back in time, I wouldn't have taken the stock.
I would've taken cash only.
I'm telling you Who's that dude? - Uh, nobody.
He's a coder.
- You got a Latino working for you? That's cool, yo.
Not a lot of Latinos working in tech.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's Latino.
Yeah, and he's one of the best coders we have.
Kind of adds a Latin flair to the company.
I told you, we do things differently.
Yeah.
You know what? I could do a cash deal for a Latino company.
I think we should get out of here, though, because I just painted over some dude's shit and people get shot behind that.
So I'll catch you on the flip.
Peace! Uh, OK.
Peace, Chuy.
Oh, God.
This is This is very real! Hey, Dinesh! Get in the fucking car.
There may be a drive-by about to happen.
What? You promised this guy ten thousand dollars without any approval? - Are you high? - A little bit, yeah.
But that's irrelevant.
A cool company needs a cool logo.
You think those guys over at Nucleus are hiring a convicted felon to paint a mural on their garage? For ten thousand dollars? No.
Look, I took a run at a burn-down chart.
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's not pretty.
The way things are going, we're not gonna finish for five months, and even with everyone on reduced salaries, we'll exhaust all our funding in four.
And that's without wasting ten thousand dollars on artwork.
"Wasting"? I got a great deal.
You know he wanted stock options until he saw Dinesh? - Hold on, what? - Don't be offended, but for some weird reason, Chuy took a look at you and thought you were a Mexican.
Why would I be offended by that? - What? - Why would I be offended by him thinking I'm Mexican? He's Mexican, right? Yeah, he is, but you're not.
You're Pakistani.
So? Actually, the very fact that you think this would be offensive to me is offensive.
You're the one being racist.
No.
I'm not the one who called you a Mexican.
"Called me a Mexican"? You're doing it again.
I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.
All right.
Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican? - I didn't.
- And why not? Because I wanted him to paint our garage for cheap.
I I genuinely don't know how to respond to that.
You know, I'm not gonna take the bait here.
I am not a racist, all right? I watch a lot of black porn.
I mean, a lot.
One question.
In this porn, is the man black, or the woman black, or are they both? Is one of those racist, and the others aren't? I'll hack his browser history.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
Yep.
Hold on.
That's unnecessary.
Hold on.
Richard? Can you explain this to me? Hmm? What? I just got a text from my friend at TechCrunch.
Pied Piper just got into this year's Start-Up Battlefield? Oh, really? Oh, that's so cool.
No.
No, it isn't.
We're already seeded, Richard.
Why would we enter a start-up competition at a tech conference? I sent in the application a few months ago and I totally forgot about it.
Relax, I will withdraw.
Relax? This house is chaos.
I gave up a great job and stock options at Hooli to come here because I thought Pied Piper could be viable, but it never will be unless we make some changes.
We need to operate like a business or we're not going to Richard? Richard? Thanks for coming in, Nelson.
Mr.
Belson is very excited to meet with you.
I thought he was in Jackson Hole this week.
Yes, he is.
We're going to call him up on the TeleHuman.
It's amazing.
It's holographic 3D teleconferencing technology that we've acquired.
It's going to feel as if Gavin is right here in the room with you.
Oh, it's him! It's him! Hello, Nelson.
Thanks for meeting with me.
Whoa.
Hi.
That's cool.
Am I a hologram over there too? What? No, of course not.
do you still talk to Richard Hendricks? Uh, yeah.
I mean, not about Nucleus or anything Why would he enter Pied Piper in TechCrunch Disrupt? I know a lot of big players have come out of it, Dropbox, Yammer, what have you.
But Peter Gregory's already funding him.
Why would he let Richard do this? It makes no sense.
I don't know.
I didn't even know Richard got in.
Is Peter Gregory toying with me? Is he trying to make Richard seem folksy? Like some aw-shucks boy-genius entering an everyman's competition? Mr.
Bel Mr.
Belson? - Can you hear me? - Hello? - Can you hear me? - Yeah, it's just - It's sort of fading.
- Hel-l-l-lo? - Hello.
- Hello-ooo.
I'm hearing you, it's just the image is Nelson, shut up for a second.
If you can hear me, make a gesture.
Is that do you I hear you.
- Is this - I have no idea what you're saying, Nelson.
Nelson.
Nelson.
Can you help me, please? OK, I think what happened was when you set it up, - you forgot to - I didn't set it up.
I paid one of you people to set it up.
Just fix it.
Uh OK.
Here's the thing, it's not working.
Um, the audio's still working.
You could just use that.
"The audio is working"? Excuse me?! I paid twenty million fucking dollars to acquire this company! Fuck you, the audio is working! Audio worked a hundred fucking years ago! You fucking piece of shit-t-t-t - It appears we've lost him.
- Yeah.
- Why don't we just Hooli-Chat instead? - Yeah.
Ah.
That's better.
Sorry.
The TeleHuman is a great piece of technology.
Unfortunately, the broadband isn't that great out here in rural Wyoming.
That presents a great business opportu Nelson, make a gesture hear me.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Uh I think you forgot to update your software.
God dammit.
Fu! Oh.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Gavin.
What's that? I'm sorry, you're kind of breaking up there.
He Hello? Hello? OK, let's start the meeting.
I think we need to define our corporate culture.
Our whole corporate culture is that we don't have a corporate culture.
That is totally ridiculous, Gilfoyle.
The main reason dogs are perceived to have a more keen sense of smell is because their noses are closer to the ground.
Therefore, with a little practice, I could easily have as keen a sense of smell as a dog's.
Guys? I guess you didn't see the sign.
We're actually having a meeting here.
Congratulations.
It's sort of for management only.
Are you fucking serious right now? Are you really kicking us out? Well, I thought, maybe you guys could just take your food into the living room? So you want to have a meeting in the room where all the food is, while we eat our food in the room where all of the computers are? Guys, just five minutes.
Please? OK, you see? This This is a case in point.
This is a company, and yet we have no boundaries and no protocol.
We need to establish a clear corporate culture or we're not gonna make it.
Take Dinesh and Gilfoyle.
They are wasting an enormous amount of time arguing.
What if we were to separate them, right? Divide their existing work space into two areas.
We could put in some kind of portable barrier He's talking about cubicles! We are not doing cubicles.
No way! No, no, no.
Don't think of it as a cubicle.
Just think of it as a neutral-colored enclosure, about yay-high, around your workspace.
OK, fine.
But do you know who uses cubicles? Every single Fortune 500 company.
Why? Because they work.
He's trying to turn us into corporate rock, Richard.
- No.
- We are punk rock.
Actually, you know, I think a better analogy would be jazz.
Like we riff and improvise around a central theme to create one cohesive piece of music No, no.
They teach fucking jazz at Juilliard.
We're not jazz.
We're fucking punk rock.
You see? You see, you guys are arguing over what metaphor to use to agree with each other.
This is the inefficiency I'm trying to eliminate.
My suggestions could actually help you beat me in this argument.
Do you see the irony there? I I can't argue with this.
Yo, Erlich! Uh, Chuy's here.
No.
And this, this This is the craziest one of all.
I mean, we're really about to spend ten thousand dollars on-on-on a logo we could generate in-house for free? It's madness.
You want a logo? Here, just There.
I just saved this company ten thousand dollars.
Are you fucking serious? Lowercase letters? lowercase "t.
" lowercase "g.
" lowercase "f.
" Every fucking company in the Valley has lowercase letters.
Why? Because it's safe.
But we aren't going to do that.
We're gonna go with Chuy.
Unless any of you gringos wants to go out there and tell a guy with three assault convictions that we're not gonna give him the money we promised him.
Hm? That's what I thought.
I mean God.
Are you still enjoying your asparagus, sir? I was never enjoying it.
I only eat it for the nutrients.
You may take it.
Oh, shit.
Peter, I don't want to upset you, but Gavin Belson just walked in.
Does he see us? I don't know.
He must know that you're here.
If I scurry to the restroom, do you imagine he would Peter! I didn't know you came here.
Gavin.
Hello.
Nice to see you.
And you, as well.
How are you? Well.
And you? Not bad.
I just got back from Jackson Hole.
Have you been? I have not.
But I hear good things.
You look well.
Are you exercising? I have begun to do Pilates.
Well I hear that's good.
I like it.
Yes.
Well, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Nice to see you, Peter.
- Goodbye now.
- OK.
You know, I almost forgot.
I saw that Pied Piper is in the Start-Up Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt.
It inspired me to call TechCrunch and offer to be their keynote speaker.
They were quite accommodating.
Especially when I said that I'd make the event the grand unveiling of Nucleus.
So, I will see you all at the conference.
This is displeasing.
I have never seen him so incensed.
What the hell were you thinking, Richard? How could you not tell us you entered TechCrunch Disrupt? I applied before I even met you guys.
I wasn't gonna say anything because I was gonna withdraw.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not? Why not? Because of you, Gavin Belson is debuting Nucleus at TCD.
If you pull out, it looks like Peter is running away from Gavin.
So like it or not, you are presenting a live demo in front of the world in eight weeks.
A live demo of what? I entered TCD with an early build of Pied Piper, when it was still just a music app.
No.
Sorry.
Executive decision, we are not doing TechCrunch.
OK.
So let me just tell you what's gonna happen.
Peter will pull all of his support and pass on any further funding, which, as you know, is the most flaming signaling risk on earth.
You'll burn through the rest of your runway, no one will step in, then you'll go bust.
I don't get it.
Doesn't Peter Gregory want what's best for the company? Look.
I'm going to be straight with you.
Peter Gregory doesn't care.
- About? - You.
Wait.
Just him or both of us? Any of you.
Pied Piper.
OK Uh, well, then why did he back us? Does he just want to piss off Gavin Belson? - He spent two hundred thousand dollars just to - Yeah, that's nothing! Peter would spend millions just to mildly annoy Gavin.
These are billionaires, Richard.
Humiliating each other is worth more to them than we'll make in a lifetime.
I see.
And you conveniently forgot to mention any of this when you were convincing me to turn down ten million dollars? And now I'm in the middle of some pissing contest between two billionaires.
In fairness, Gavin only offered you the ten million dollars because we started pursuing you But he offered it to me, Monica! He offered it to me.
Ten million dollars and I didn't take it.
Because you came to me when I was puking and freaking out and told me that Peter Gregory believed in me, when in reality, he didn't even give a flying fuck! - Richard - Oh, my God.
I didn't turn down ten million dollars because of Peter Gregory, Monica! I turned it down because of you! However angry he is, I am one-tenth as angry.
Because one of the ten million would've been mine.
- Because I I own ten percent.
- I know.
- Of Pied Piper - I know! It's push.
We didn't think we were going to get this thing done when we had five months to do it.
Now we have two? Granted, it's not ideal, but we're just gonna have to What the good fuck? What is happening? Is that Dinesh? Is that the Statue of Liberty? And it's There's penetration.
Oh! Hey, neighbor.
- Ashley's getting big! - Aw.
She looks What do we do? I don't know.
Paint over it.
No, no, no.
You can't paint over it.
It's like the code of the streets.
People get shot behind that.
- Oh, good.
- Hey.
So what do you guys think, man? Uhh I think Erlich had a few thoughts.
So, I gotta I'll let you Uhh Here's the headline: there's a lot right with it.
A lot of good stuff in there.
But I just Do you think the piece is working? I mean Maybe it's a bit too graphic for the space? No way.
Look at it.
It comments on the Latino struggle for justice in America.
But even without all the symbolism, it's just aesthetically pleasing.
Yeah.
All right, here's the real shit, Chuy.
Uh, you know, our prize coder, he's actually not Latino.
What? Yeah.
Point of fact is, he's Pakistani.
Homes, you lied to me.
No, no, no.
You thought he was Latino, and I thought I would be racist telling you, you were wrong.
Come on, man.
Why would you think that? Thinking that, now that's racist.
God, I can't win with that.
Look, Chuy, painting a guy named Dinesh Chugtai as an Aztec warrior just doesn't make sense.
Yeah.
You know what? I think you might be right, boss.
Great.
That's So Perfect.
So change that and then don't have him be fucking the literal symbol of freedom.
And then, whatever else you wanna do.
- All right.
- All right.
If I had known, we could have withdrawn your application before any of this happened.
This is exactly why we need to have clearer lines of communication.
I know, Jared, I know.
Listen, I'd like to institute an organizational system called "scrum.
" Scrum is designed to All right, you have one hour! Go! No.
No.
Just musty.
Uhh, what's going on? Gilfoyle bet me a hundred bucks that if I touched one object in this room, he could find it just by sniffing.
OK.
Not now, please.
It has to be now.
I just masturbated to heighten my focus.
I have a fifteen-minute refractory period.
- Ow.
- Uhh, well, we have a lot of work to get done - So maybe we should do that instead, please.
- Dude, relax, OK? We each ripped through a full module this morning.
We're just taking a little break.
DRM is now a thing of beauty.
Wait.
You did DRM? - Yeah.
- I did DRM.
Why did you do DRM? I said I would do DRM, you would do error handling.
Anything to do with "error" sounds like your whole vibe.
- Yeah, I handle errors like you every day.
- Scrum? - Yes, scrum.
- Scrum.
So from "rules based filtering" we got to "workflow," at which point that card is moved from the "icebox" into the "in progress" column and it stays there until it is ready for "testing.
" OK.
This increases visibility into our team's progress.
And that, gentlemen, is scrum.
Welcome to the next eight weeks of our lives.
This just became a job.
OK, so here are the cards I'm adding under this epic for the ingestion engine.
And there are three stories here.
How long do we think each one will take? I don't know.
Who cares? Four hours apiece? Yeah.
Maybe for you.
Each of those tasks would take me three max.
Not "tasks," "stories.
" I've got a story, why don't you choke on my balls? Well, how about this? Why don't you each take one story, right and we'll see who's right? You see what he's doing, right? He's trying to get us to compete so we work faster.
He thinks this wall of Psych is going to motivate us? Fine.
Don't compete.
Do them at whatever speed you like.
Uh, Jared.
Uh I know these guys.
I really don't think scrum is gonna work for them.
Whoa Just trust in the system.
So we're just going to work at a nice, leisurely pace, right? Sure.
Wait, why are you typing faster? I'm not.
Maybe my leisurely pace is just a little faster than yours.
Cock-sucker.
Boo-yah.
Guys? Have you been out front yet? 'Cause you might wanna come see this.
- I'm good.
- Fuck off, we're working.
Wow.
This took a lot of work.
I mean, I'm already smiling.
Did he really have to paint me giving the thumbs-up? It's gratuitous.
Really? That's the gratuitous part? Well, and Dinesh's shaft - Oh, no.
- Uh Oh shit.
Are one of you the homeowner? Yeah.
I am.
We've had a number of complaints about your artwork here.
Look, what you do inside the house is your own business - Oh, no.
We don't We don't do that.
- Oh, no! But that is you, is it not? The individual on the right? Yeah.
You're gonna need to paint over this.
Oh, I don't think the artist would like that, he's Latino.
- Was that racist? - Why are you asking me? Oh.
I mean, I could've asked anybody, but your race It doesn't matter.
I have a solution.
We put it up.
We don't put it down.
Leave it up.
No, no, no.
No, no, no! Close it! No Look at this left from the previous tenant.
Unbelievable.
I can't believe I didn't enter the garage until this point.
I mean, is that marijuanas? We're gonna need to take those.
Or, we leave them and wait to see if the criminal returns to the scene of the crime.
What do you say, please? OK.
So I keep the mural, and I keep the ten G's.
What do you get? I just thought when I got a new garage door, maybe you could come and paint a new logo.
Something just as artistic, but maybe a little less challenging? Hey! Don't look under there.
Get away from there! That's not me.
Um, just to be honest with you, like, I really, really, really need this.
So I'm trying to be vulnerable in front of you.
I don't know.
Is this a safe place? Look, you can be vulnerable, esÃ©, but this ain't a safe place.
A plumber got stabbed just last week, right where you're standing.
What?! Jesus Christ! What Why would you stab a plumber? All right.
It was worth a try.
Thanks anyway, Chuy.
Wait.
Just go ahead and leave the mural.
I like looking at it.
And plus, I think I know what kind of logo you white boys might like.
Uh, that's amazing.
Thank you, Chuy! - Uh, yeah.
Appreciate it.
- All right, man.
- Yes, one of those too.
- All right.
- Another one down.
- Did you really? You still working on that last one? Take your time.
There's no rush, Dinesh.
Feeling pretty happy about yourself? I'm pretty happy with ourself.
Hello? Hey, is Is Richard here? I don't know.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Come to check up on your investment? Listen, you were right.
I played you a little.
Maybe a lot.
I got caught up in making the deal.
All right? And I would like to say I was just doing my job, but that's the excuse that the Nazis used, so I'm not really sure how effective that one is.
Your point being? I'm sorry.
But I'm also not sorry.
The reason I pushed Peter to seed you is, I think you have an unbelievably good platform.
Way better than the rest of his other compression plays, which I apologize for not telling you about.
Look, I know eight weeks isn't a lot of time to get this ready, but I get the feeling you're the kind of guy that does better when there's a fire lit under his ass.
It's a pretty big fire.
It is.
And by the way, you're the only one of Peter's companies that I've invested ten percent of my annual salary in.
So I really hope that you can do this.
Uh, well, you know, I guess we'll find out.
I saw the logo out front.
I didn't know it was Cool.
Guys, the new logo! - Can we please both go? - You go first.
I love it.
Well, it's lowercase, but at least it isn't racist.
Is it? It's Chuy Ramirez? I'm impressed.
He sold a mural today for a half-million bucks.
It wasn't on a garage door, was it? You don't think it's too incendiary for the offices? Kevin, you got where you are by challenging sensibilities.
You know me well.
It is pretty raunchy, though.

N/A - Third Party Insourcing

Kidney function, liver function, testosterone I don't know how you did it, but you have essentially aged 40 years in the last seven weeks.
Wow.
Really? We had a meth addict in here this morning who was biologically younger than you are, and he's 58.
MySpace guy.
So what is going on? Uh It's this cloud service configuration, - I've been stuck on it for over a week.
- Wow.
I'm a good programmer.
I mean, it's the only thing I am good at.
I mean, last year, I threw a Frisbee and it chipped my tooth.
That's more of a dental issue.
Yup, OK, I The point is, I learned Ruby on Rails over a weekend when I was 17.
I should be able to learn cloud, I have to.
Can I give you my professional opinion, as your doctor? You should have taken that ten million dollars from Gavin Belson, OK? But regrets will kill ya so try not to dwell on it.
I tried to tell you.
Outside help? No, we're not getting any outside help.
It's a week until TechCrunch, Richard.
We can't wait any longer.
Richard, look at the board.
OK, cloud architecture is just a giant turd that is clogging up our pipes.
We have to call in a plumber to fix it.
OK, I hate that metaphor, but Erlich is right.
Gilfoyle and I finished the distribution services days ago and we're just sitting around waiting for you.
- I can solve it.
- Richard, you're a fucking rock star, OK? You just don't know cloud, this tiny, little, shitty area, which is becoming super important, and in many ways is the future of computing.
That sort of went south on me, but you understand what I'm saying.
I've already talked to Peter Gregory about insourcing a consultant.
I've made contact with a programmer whose cloud architecture is supposed to be insane.
They call him The Carver.
The Carver? That Black Hat guy who apparently hacked into the Bank of America and took down their entire system, that The Carver? We should get him if we can.
OK, we can talk to the guy, but, I mean, he's really gonna have to sell me.
Six months ago, these guys had 35 million and Series B Financing.
Now The Carver's here doing teardown.
He's basically moving their carcass to the cloud.
Don't touch anything.
Failure is contagious.
I think that's him.
Excuse me, Mr.
Carver? Yeah, uh, people refer to me as The Carver, but no one actually calls me that, it's what people call a screen name.
You know.
I'm Kevin.
OK, Kevin, um, we're from Pied Piper, we spoke earlier.
- Yeah, so you guys are fucked, huh? - No.
No, we're not fucked.
Yes, we are totally fucked.
We have a live demo in one week and our cloud is in the shitter.
- That's accurate.
- Wait, are you Richard? Yes, I am.
Yeah, your algorithm is solid.
It's a really good schema.
OK, thanks.
I did think you'd be younger.
What are you, 25? Twenty-six.
Yikes.
Uh, so I have a Model U.
N.
thing on Monday, but maybe I could burn through your gig over the weekend.
Mmm.
You think you can do our whole job in two days? I know I can do it in two days.
I pound Mello Yello, Oreos and Adderall and I don't sleep until I'm done.
OK.
But you know what? I also have an offer to do some migration at Gittawonk this weekend.
It's It's kind of chill, and frankly, their tech's a little stronger.
Whoa.
What? What? You think Gittawonk's tech is stronger than ours? I'm sorry, I don't remember reading in PandoDaily that Gavin Belson and Peter Gregory were fighting over Gittawonk.
No one offered ten million dollars to acquire Gittawonk.
Yeah, I agree with Richard, you should come work for us.
- What No - What's it gonna take, a blow-job? Because Richard will suck the dick right off of your pelvis.
Now you make me laugh, shaggy man.
All right, I'm in.
I'll see you guys Friday.
OK.
- Well done.
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
Hi, um, would you guys be interested in buying some candy so you can send my church group to camp? Nope.
Hundred bucks says there's no church.
Whole thing's a scam, little scumbags.
They're just children.
Looks like Gilfoyle and his lady Satanist are back from the airport.
Can you imagine what kind of shit-show this one's gonna be? He says that she has an Amy Winehouse vibe.
What does that mean? All tatted-up and nowhere to go.
- Hooked on OxyContin? - Decomposing? Oh.
Oh, OK, that was dark.
Gentlemen, this is Tara.
- Hi.
- Tara, this is the fellas: Jared, Dinesh, Erlich and Richard.
- It's Erlich.
- It's great to finally meet you guys.
Hi.
All right.
Jesus, where did he get Amy Winehouse from? I mean, I'd have sex with that if you hose the Gilfoyle off of her.
It's weird having a girl in the house.
There's a very strange energy.
Hm.
Hello Kevin.
OK, Richard, I just need you to approve Kevin's fee.
I got Erlich to sign and you sign right there.
Twenty thousand dollars for two days.
You know who else thought my price was too high? Bitraptor.
Who? Exactly.
Great.
Peter Gregory is on his way out of town so I'm gonna hustle out there and get him to co-sign these and the check and I'll be back as soon as I can.
Thank you.
You OK over there? You have any questions? Yeah, one question.
Cool.
Shoot.
Why do you keep your lips pressed so tight together when you're not talking? 'Cause they're like white.
It looks uncomfortable.
Hey, guys.
Hey, Kevin, um, so how did you bypass Bank of America's network security? I want details.
My lawyers told me I'm not allowed to discuss it.
Totally get it.
That's baller.
- Hey, babe? - Hmm.
You're up.
- All right, I'm gonna go have a shower.
- Mm-hm.
- Uh, what was that? - What? Tara just whispered something to you and then she looked at me in a weird way.
No, she didn't.
Yeah, she did.
What's up? Do you know what compersion is? It's when someone takes pleasure in seeing their loved one gratified by another person.
Sexually.
It's the opposite of jealousy.
It sounds like it's the opposite of normal.
Why are you telling me about this thing? As shocking as this is Tara is attracted to you.
Come again? Yeah, freaked me out too, at first.
I don't like the "at first" part at all.
What are you saying? Since I abide by the maxim, "Do what thou wilt, that is the whole of the law" if you want to fuck my girlfriend, I'm OK with it.
Jesus Christ, man, I could barely stand next to you when you're in your towel.
I don't want to have a threesome with you.
I'm not talking about a threesome.
Listen, I don't even have to be in the room, unless that's better for you.
OK, no, I don't Right, so we're all settled then.
- Yep.
- Do you need parking validation? No, I used Lyft.
So I'll Lyft it back.
Why don't I have Peter's car take you home.
He's not using it, we're shipping off to Arallon tomorrow.
- Arallon? - Yeah, the island Peter's building.
What's the the red line? That's the International Date Line.
The island's built right on it so the western half can celebrate the first new years on Earth, then the next day, they walk over to the eastern half and celebrate the last new years on Earth.
But if you can walk, why does he need the car on the island? Peter's not really big on walking.
So I'll just have the guys pull it up front for you.
Great.
Driverless car.
Select destination.
Hi.
Um I'm going to 5230 Newell Road, Palo Alto Route guidance calibrated.
four point six miles.
Buckle up, please.
OK.
Enjoy your ride.
You? Tara wants to have sex with you? You sure? Yeah, Gilfoyle just told me, to my face.
He told you that Tara wants to copulate with someone else in the house other than him and that someone is you, Dinesh? Yeah, that's You know, you seem confused by this but for a different reason than I am.
Don't you think it's weird that Tara wants some strange and she chooses you over me, the logical person in the house? OK, I see where we are ending up on this.
Thank you for your time.
Wait, are you sure that she didn't ask Gilfoyle for a danish and maybe you misheard her? You're probably right, she just wanted to fuck a danish.
Wait, you just built all the indexes on the fly? Yeah, of course.
OK, well Well, then what's that? The key value store.

Tara and I are going to a Satanic baptism.
You wanna come? Stu Burns decided to walk the left-hand path with us.
The database administrator for Yahoo is becoming a Satanist? We're everywhere.
Hey, Erlich, are you coming? Dinesh is.
He is? This is Monica.
Hi Monica, it's Jared.
Uh, quick question Jared, I can't talk right now.
One of our assistants has been confusing the eastern, western time zones of Arallon on work orders.
Now a bunch of important things are happening a day early.
Peter is going to be furious when he finds out.
He's going to make that noise.
Oh, shit, that's him on the other line.
I gotta go.
- Oh wait Monica.
It just - Hi, Peter.
Hello, Monica? Um, car? Mr.
Car? Uh, excuse me.
Arallon is an island, so how are we? Oh, no, no! No.
Stop.
Let me out.
Mmm.
Um Uh, that's not good.
Oh, no! No! Excuse me please! Please honk.
Please honk.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
No, no.
Please.
Please.
Oh, no, that's not good.

We bring thy garden, o mighty Lucifer, the fragrances which abound therein, vapors of What the fuck are we doing here? Look at these fucking people.
Through this, the black flame of Satan thou walkest in Hell.
The gates are flung wide and thy passage is heralded by the deathless cries of his guardian beasts.
Breathe of his breath, o brother of the night and nourish his waning brain.
- From the despair - I just figured it out.
It all makes sense.
Figured what out? Why Tara might be in to you more than me.
She's attracted to ugliness.
- Oh, fuck you.
- No, think about it.
This is the life that she chooses, right? She's attracted to unattractiveness.
Look at all these ugly people and Gilfoyle and now you.
That's ridiculous.
I'm way more attractive than you are.
- No, you're not.
- Way better looking.
By no metric could you possibly be considered more attractive than me.
You're saying that every woman in the entire world would think you're more attractive than I am? Yes.
Unless they're completely fucked up.
Damn it.
You doing OK there? Yep, yeah.
Fine, just, you know, it's big orchestration stuff, a lot of moving parts.
Nothing you need to worry about.
You just focus on the cloud.
I'm here if you need me.
You know what? Uh I know it's not what we hired you for, but I am actually having a little trouble with the data replication in the persistence layer.
Move over.
Uh-huh.
Oh, Christ.
I'm much more handsome than you are.
No, my face is completely symmetrical.
You know what my nickname was when I was a kid? - What? - Pakistani Denzel.
You look nothing like him.
Denzel Washington has a beautiful smile.
You look ridiculous.
Hail Satan, it is done.
- Hail Satan.
- Hail Satan, it is it's done.
Well, thanks for coming, everyone.
Brother Jason was kind enough to furnish this week's food.
It's Chick-fil-A.
I know, they're on the Christian right, but darned if that chicken isn't good.
I think the Dark Lord would understand.
Also a reminder.
If you parked in the Sav-On parking lot, they do tow.
Well, I didn't know if you wanted original Oreos or Double Stuf so I went a little nutty and I got both.
How's it, um - Fuck.
Fuck.
- Kevin? Hello? Fuck.
What are you doing down here? I did it again, I did it again.
- Did what? - I did it again.
No.
What is this? Did you overwrite the data schema? Why would you do this? You don't ever do this! That's exactly what they said when I was working at BofA.
Working at BofA? I thought you hacked in.
No.
I was a consultant at the retail banking services.
I crashed their entire system.
It took a team of seven engineers more than a week to comb through all the code and find my mistake.
And the only way that I ever avoided being sued was by agreeing to never tell anyone that I worked there.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck, what?! I just told you.
Now I could get in trouble.
Trouble? You just skull-fucked my whole system.
I am going to punch you in the fucking We don't like sacrifice goats or anything.
We're not like the Order of the Golden Dawners, you know.
Yeah.
Richard, are you OK? Um Mmm Dinesh, uh, we may have a slight problem.
The Carver just carved up our entire platform.
What the fuck? Yeah, the database layers, the application layers, even the chef scripts are fucked.
The little fucker must have hacked into the DDL tables like he did with BofA.
He didn't hack into BofA's.
He was consulting there at the time, when he took down the system by accident.
- Oh, you told them too? - What the fuck? Richard, why would you let that little fetus access the DDL? Because I thought that fetus was better than me and so did you and everybody and you just, you pressured me into hiring him Yes, Richard, for the cloud, to deploy the cloud.
So that you could do what you do best and concentrate on everything else which the fetus just fucked up.
You need to drag this little shit stain You hear that? Out from under this table and have him go through every single line of code with you to unfuck it while it's still unfuckable.
I should not have eaten all of that Satanist chicken.
OK, and with this one here, did you delete it or just move it? Hello? Kevin.
Maybe.
I don't know.
What? What does that mean? What's wrong with you, man? I can't focus.
I'm out of Adderall.
Where's that Jared guy? He was getting my refill.
That's actually a really good question.
I don't know where he is.
The Carver's Adderall prescription.
I hope that's not a problem.
Dead battery.
That's a problem.
I need to lay down.
What? No! You said you could code for 48 hours straight.
That's like your thing.
Yeah, how the fuck do you think I do that? Adderall.
Well, we don't have any.
It's really bright in here.
Who takes Adderall anymore.
Half the kids in Palo Alto.
Hey.
Any of you guys currently on Adderall and, uh, you know, want to make 50 dollars? Oh, boy.
What do you mean, it's not Adderall? It's Adderall! I know what Adderall looks like.
It's not Adderall.
Uh, excuse me.
Caleb? There's been some kind of mistake.
What you sold me was not actually Adderall.
So maybe we could Do you think you could get me some real Adderall? Yeah, yeah, of course.
Um I could do that or, um, I can give you some of this.
Ow! OK, I'm gonna You're gonna do what, bitch? Call the cops on me? Tell them you got the wrong illegal drugs from a kid? You dumb piece of shit.
Get the fuck out of here.
- Uh, you - Run! - All right, I'm running.
- Mm-hm.
Keep running! Stupid Richard, what's wrong? Have you been crying? Hey! Which one was it? It was church candy, wasn't it? You just brought piss to a shit fight, you little cunt! Ow! No, no, no! Now you get in your fucking house and you get me five Adderall or I'll slit your fucking throat! You understand? I'll kill your mother! I'll rape your father! I'll curb-stomp that little face so hard that your teeth will go flying, you little shit! Now go! Go! Go! Go! - Get me five Adderall, right now! - OK! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Hi.
- Tara.
- Hello.
- Hi.
First of all So, um I have thought about it.
A lot.
To be honest, elements of this arrangement still trouble me.
However, I have not had a lot of sexual experiences.
So I feel it may be foolish to turn this down.
So as long as Gilfoyle is not in the room and I can verify that the door is locked then I have concluded that yes I would love to have sexual relations with you Tara.
Yeah.
Uh, what are you talking about? Gilfoyle told me.
I know you want to have sex with me.
Gilfoyle? Would you come in here for a second? Um - Hm? - Um Did you tell Dinesh that I want to have sex with him? No.
Oh, wait, yeah, I totally did.
I forgot about that.
I was really high.
I was just fucking with him.
Did he believe me? Uh Did you just present yourself to my woman? Uh Oh, this is outstanding.
Oh, my God, that is so mean of you! Look at how cute he is.
He's adorable.
You're adorable.
Don't call me ador It's very emasculating.
What kind of fucking idiot listens to what Gilfoyle has to say? OK, Tara, here's what it is.
If you can tell me to my face that you seriously find Dinesh more attractive than me, then and only then will I concede defeat.
What? And our regression test is done.
Yes.
It's clear, we all test out.
The system's stable again.
Thank God.
Now we can move on to the next module and I can forget you ever existed.
Can you do me a favor? Don't tell anyone I cratered this bad.
I won't tell anyone I hired you if you won't tell anyone you worked here.
Oh, the BofA deal.
Got it.
Well, I'm gonna call my mom and have her pick me up.
Your mom? Oh, by the way, you owe me 20 thousand dollars.
What a dick.
You have to talk to Jared about that.
Where is Jared? Excuse me.
Can you help me? Obstacle averted.
Resuming operations.
Please be careful.
Please be careful.
Please be careful.



******************************************
N/A - Proof of Concept

The core compression algorithm is optimal.
All the test cases ran optimal.
The Weissman score is optimal.
Looks like Nucleus is optimal.
Good.
Good.
Congratulations, guys.
- Oh yeah.
- Oh, dog.
Richard, the ingestion engine is ready for testing.
Have you seen Richard? He's in there, having a little trouble with his personal ingestion engine.
Still? It's been an hour.
He's gotta get this done.
Oh, he's got his laptop in there, on top of his lap.
Hey, Richard.
Don't talk to me while I'm in the bathroom please.
Well, snap it off, we gotta go.
I know.
Just don't talk to me while I'm in here.
It's weird.
Oh, my God.
Jared's been back from that island for a whole day and he didn't get any toilet paper? Are you serious? Is Jared out there? I thought you didn't want me to talk to you while you were in the bathroom.
Make up your mind.
You know what? Just get away from the door, please.
Friday, the pool cleaner comes.
- Do you understand? - Yes.
And tomorrow is trash day so make sure all the cans are out front.
Yes.
Now, you are under no circumstances to order any movie on demand, adult or otherwise.
Yes.
OK, has anything that I've just said confused you? - Yes.
- Goddamn it! Jesus, Cher.
Are you bringing your whole closet? I'm a pro, Dinesh.
I won't apologize for it.
I dress according to the moods that I sense in the room.
As such, I must have options.
We all packed and ready to go? We can take my car but gas is on the company.
Hello? Did everyone leave? No.
What? Oh.
Whoa, whoa I don't know how you read your screen in the car.
It makes me sick as a dog.
I'm OK as long as I don't think about it.
Besides, the presentation is tomorrow.
So if you just don't think about it it really doesn't bother you to be staring at the screen when the car's moving and turning and you're all queasy Oh, God! - Gilfoyle.
- See, I knew it bothered you.
Fucking liar.
So I'm a little behind, being stuck on that island for four days, but I think I'm on top of everything.
OK, give me your IDs and I'll go register us There you are.
Got your credentials and wristbands for the walkthrough at 4:00 today.
Uh, walkthrough? Yeah, basically, it's a sound check for the competition.
Uh, yeah, we didn't know about that.
Did I not tell you about the walkthrough? I am so sorry.
That's why I'm here.
Peter's on safari with Lorne Michaels and Kanye West until next week so I can put all of my attention on you guys for once.
I am so sorry.
I thought that I talked to you guys about the walk Gentlemen, welcome to the big show.
TechCrunch motherfucking Disrupt.
OK, guys, this place is a vortex of distraction Normally in the tech world it's two percent women.
Guys, these next three days, 15 percent.
It's a goddamn meat market.
I need you to focus.
How we do here is the entire future of your company.
Don't screw it all up now.
We have to knock them dead in the preliminaries tomorrow so we can move on to the finals on Friday.
I have a question.
The program says that Dan Melcher is judging our round.
Is there any way to get him removed? Not unless there's a conflict of interest.
Well, there may be.
I did have sexual intercourse with his wife.
What? It was three years ago.
So one of the guys judging us wants to fucking kill you? Maybe.
I don't know if he found out.
Either way, Richard, you may have to present instead of me so be prepared.
What, me? Present? No.
We may be fine.
We may be totally fine.
We also may be totally fucked.
I'll let you know either way.
I'm gonna go network.
Don't approach me.
I don't want to present.
Besides, I'm not even done with the demo.
OK, Richard, you need to go to the hotel right now and finish.
- Oh, you already checked us into the hotel? - Yeah.
Yeah.
OK, I'm gonna do this module by module.
Dinesh, you built the edge video player so I'm gonna start with you first.
OK? OK, you guys set up the booth, OK? Um I think it's this way.
You think? A few flyers, that's all we have? Yeah, I think it is.
Hello, what's your name? Visit us at microdrone.
com Oh, wow, Microdrone.
They just closed $17 million in seed funding.
Hi.
Hello.
Excuse me.
Pied Piper? You guys are competing in the StartUp Battlefield, right? Everyone has been talking about your compression rate.
I mean, it is supposed to be sick.
Yeah.
Anyway, you must be great with Java and I just cannot seem to figure out this stupid bug.
Do you mind? I'll be back.
Thank you.
If we integrate one module every two hours we should be in great shape Richard, follow me.
Follow me.
Follow me.
- All right.
See you at the hotel.
- See you.
Very soon, I hope.
Hey, man.
Just wanted to say good luck.
OK, thanks.
But what's with all the Sorry.
I just can't be seen talking to you, you know? Hooli people all over the place.
I don't know, man, I'm just really into this whole rest and vest life, you know, way more than I thought I would be.
I just don't want to rock the boat.
Oh, hey, did I tell you? I'm getting a boat.
- Wow.
- And a boat guy to take care of it.
You have to have a boat guy.
- Oh yeah, you've gotta have a boat guy - if you have a boat.
Hey, um, you know that girl, right? Sherry, I think her name was.
She said you guys went to school together.
Uh, OK, yeah.
I saw her at the Valleywag party last night, which was crazy, by the way, dude, there must've been like 12 girls there.
- Holy shit.
- Nuts.
Anyway, she said you guys went out a couple times and then she dumped you and you became obsessed with her.
What? What? She said I was obsessed? She said obsessed.
Uh, that's bullshit, 'cause I think we went out two times.
Uh, it was nothing so how could I be obsessed? That's No, you're going down! Nucleus is gonna crush Wide Diaper.
You never shoulda said no to my man, Gavin Belson.
OK.
Seeded quite a few new companies.
Spinder.
It's like Tinder but for spinsters.
Elderly women looking for sex.
There's this girl who's walking around, saying that I'm obsessed with her.
Now that just really pisses me off That's fascinating.
Let's just forget about it, OK? Yeah.
I mean it's It's just so fucked up, right? I mean, I barely remember her.
And it's just so insulting to have someone walking around spreading lies about you.
Right? I wonder who she's working with.
Like I wonder who she's here with because if she's telling her coworkers, then that's a whole 'nother group of people I gotta worry about.
Richard, you don't have to worry about anything - except for Pied Pier right now.
- Yeah, I know.
Because we have less than 24 hours 'til the preliminaries.
No one's worrying, that's the thing.
- Perfect.
- Perfect.
OK, her.
She used the word "obsessed", Dinesh.
- "Obsessed.
" - Richard, I don't care.
Neither do I.
That's the entire point.
I'm just gonna check her Instagram real quick.
Because if she's posting comments about me being obsessed I mean, I can't just ignore that.
Would you be interested in a device that links to your smartphone and lets you know, even before it happens, whether you're having a panic attack - or a heart attack? - Yeah, yeah.
OK, here's how Panic-A-Tech works.
You wear this on your finger all day and it tracks your vitals.
Or if that's too embarrassing, there's also a Bluetooth suppository and that goes right where you think it goes.
And that comes with a retrieval kit.
Was he like, "Bro, you're my bro," or was he like, "I wanna shoot you in the face and watch you bleed out all over the stage 'cause you fucked my wife, you cocksuck.
" Right in the middle.
It was like: Huh.
What happened? How's it going at the hotel? Weird.
He switched to meta-data extraction and now wants to see you.
Meta-data? Already? Makes no sense.
He seems very distracted.
OK, guys, since we're kind of playing from behind here I put together a little secret weapon.
I I went through the entire list of conference participants and I found images and I found bios and I printed them out so we have them all in one place.
- Why did you do that? - Uh, OK.
Who's this guy? Watch.
He is Rick Smith, co-founder of Crosscut Ventures.
How did you? ID-Keen.
It's this facial recognition app that Monica put on our phones.
You just point it at anybody, tells you who they are and how important they are to the conference.
You're not showing up at all.
Yeah, maybe I'm not getting a No, I'm getting a signal.
OK.
Um, well Ooh, Jared, Jared, recycling's over there.
Hey, so what's the deal? Does the judge know or not? I don't know, Monica.
He's toying with me.
Or maybe he's not.
I can't fucking figure it out.
Erlich, you need to stop this.
His wife is here.
Grow a pair and talk to her, find out for sure.
Why don't you grow a pair and I'll talk to her.
Hmph.
What? Hey.
Do you happen to know Java? Are you kidding? It's like my specialty.
Will you help me? Oh, it would be my honor.
Yes? Oh, sorry.
Um, I must not have the right room.
I'm looking for Dan Melcher.
Yeah, that's us.
Oh, it is? OK.
I was looking to speak with his wife.
That's me.
I'm, well, his new wife, we just got married.
Oh, congratulations.
Uh, what happened with Madelyn? - You're a friend of Dan's? - Yeah.
We've We have a common interests.
- Uh, many common interests.
- Yeah.
Well, she was a nightmare.
Pills, in and out of rehab.
Had all of these disgusting affairs.
You know, the divorce nearly killed Dan.
Really? Disgusting affairs.
Well, I I feel terrible.
No, it's fine.
He's put it behind him.
All of it? I mean, every aspect of it? Mm-hmm.
Well, that is That is great to hear.
What if she's spreading this lie to everyone at this conference? I mean, honestly, Gilfoyle Richard, stop talking about this or I have to punch you in the face.
Fuck.
It is huge.
- Uh - Very, very huge.
Check, one-two two, tsetse fly, tsetse fly.
Hey, how's the demo coming? Um, we're getting there.
Uh, definitely Getting there.
Gentlemen, I bring good tidings.
Turns out that Melcher is divorced, remarried and has put the previously relationship behind him completely.
Problem solved.
That's great.
It sure is, Richard, it sure as hell is.
Look at these poor fuckers.
They don't even know what's about to hit 'em.
The hammer of God.
I am so sorry! I am so sorry.
I thought you guys were gonna come get me and and I'm sorry.
Wait, Jared, what are you doing here? What? - Who's watching the booth? - Yeah.
I thought that maybe Monica could She's not in the company.
We need her here.
That's the thing.
All right, everybody, this run-through is for essential personnel only, essential only.
Oh.
- We need someone in the booth is the thing.
- Right.
You're essential to the booth.
Right.
All right, each team will have six minutes for presentation and demo, at which point the judges will ask a few questions Uh, do you mind if I break in here, just one question.
Uh, are the judges allowed to send us through to the finals immediately after we present or do we have to wait until everyone else has gone? Well, I'm just saying what everybody's thinking.
Hello, what's your name? Visit us at microdrone.
com - Uh, excuse me, no thank you.
- a free video of you - at TechCrunch Disrupt.
- Uh, no thank you.
Nathan.
Are you Nathan Zimmerman, CEO of Flingual? I I Whoever's doing this, no thank you.
Yeah, I think we got a dead zone, an audio dead zone right here.
Listen to this.
Hear that? Compared to OK, here's what I want, as soon as the music comes up - Music? - I want you to hit me with a spotlight, bam! And a hard spot.
Better yet, do you have those spotlights that come up from the ground, - like in Pride Fighting.
- Uh I can check.
OK, so two of those, one on each side and then one in the center so that it casts my shadow behind me, like a giant looking over his own shoulder.
- - Do you have any wind machines.
I'm gonna need two of those Are you humming to yourself? Was was I? Uh, you know, honestly, I may have found the perfect woman.
Whoa.
What? Who? Who? She's in the booth right next to us, Charlotte.
She's not even physically my type, she has blonde hair and these stupid pink streaks and doesn't seem to be dominant at all.
However, I think I'm in love.
Whoa.
She invited me to her room to watch Cloud Atlas later tonight.
Oh yeah, that means she wants you to lay her.
Is that definitive? I mean, nobody can watch more than like a minute of that film.
So what's the deal? I mean, is she hot? Yeah, I mean, she's attractive, but almost every woman is attractive.
It was her mind.
She wrote this Java method that was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.
Elegant, tight.
There's just something so hot about a woman that can code like that.
You know, I just want to crawl in her frontal lobe and What's up? You know I wrote that code, right? No, this code was on her system.
A banged up 15-inch MacBook Pro with shitty stickers on it? Everyone here has a beat up 15-inch MacBook Pro With a 1.
3 chip and only two gigs of RAM? She doesn't know Java.
I wrote that code.
- You said you were in love with her mind.
- Oh fuck.
- You realize what's going on, right? - Uh It's not her you're sexually attracted to, it's my code.
Shut the That is the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever h Just face it, Dinesh, you're gay for my code, you're code gay.
No! No, I'm into her.
Her, OK? Fuck your code! You'd like to fuck my code, wouldn't you? Hey, would you like to masturbate to the subroutine I just wrote? No! It's I'm I'm And then I'll sort of close right here in the center with a confidence and poise that, well, they probably won't have seen up until this point.
And then at that point we've got some photos that we're gonna throw up on the big screen.
Photos? Yeah, you know, just a few.
Gandhi, MLK, me as an inquisitive child.
Richard, could you please.
Oh, yes, sorry.
I'll just plug it in here.
No! Don't! - Don't! - Oh, shi - What the fuck!? - Shit.
- Oh, she's here.
- Mmm.
Oh, shit, it's frozen.
It's frozen.
That is not me, obviously.
He's obsessed with me.
I'm sorry.
Hey, what's wrong? I'm just a little nervous 'cause you're so beautiful.
Oh? Random question So you didn't write any of that Java code? Uh-uh.
But I write all of our tweets and we have like a couple hundred followers.
Couple hundred Oh, let me move this.
Oh, that's the code your friend wrote.
- Yeah, it is.
- It's really good, huh? It's fine.
I don't care about it.
Mm, there we go.
Oh, fu Come on, focus, focus.
Richard's not gonna finish, is he? He'll finish, Gilfoyle, he has to.
Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine.
I knew it.
You couldn't do it.
Please shut up.
Shut up.
Why is it that every time I'm about to have sex with a lady he's all up in there somehow? Finally, just us.
Guys, this round is on me.
Hey, Jared.
There you guys go.
- To Pied Piper.
Hmm? - To Pied Piper.
Here, here.
Yeah, drink it up.
But it's not gonna change who you are.
Monica, can I speak to you for a minute? Yeah.
No, Sherry, it has to be now! Oh, shit.
OK, look, we need to talk.
You keep telling people I'm obsessed with you.
- Richard, why don't you just take a step back - It's not true No, no, no, let me finish.
OK, did I put your picture up on the big screen in the auditorium? Yes.
But that's because I was showing you to my friends to prove a point that I'm not obsessed with you.
- Richard, I'm gonna go now.
- No, I'm not obsessed with you, Sherry! I'm I'm not.
That guy Richard I was telling you about just totally freaked out on me.
Yeah, the obsessed guy.
- Where are you? - You've been doing this ever since - we arrived at the conference.
- Which elevators? You really think that you can come between me and Richard Hendricks? We're partners, OK, and I've devoted every second of my waking life for the past two months to him, OK? I am devoted to him and to the precious thing that we're building together! I'm his partner.
I can tell when he's vomiting - What? No.
- because he's nervous or when he's vomiting - Never mind, Kate, I'm fine.
- because he's sick or when he's vomiting because he had cilantro, which he loves but he shouldn't have because it makes him I had no idea that you felt this way.
I mean it, I am so sorry.
I mean, I'm obsessed with her Richard, can I talk to you for a second? Uh, OK.
I owe you an apology.
I was way off base.
Well, yeah, you were.
He cleared it all up for me.
- Jared? Really? - Yeah.
He's your partner, right? Yeah, he is.
One of many.
Probably too many.
How could I not have seen this? Obviously you're not obsessed with me.
Richard, it's none of my business, but be safe.
- OK? - OK.
Of course I'm safe.
I backup my whole system like five times a day.
So uh, Jared, hey, thank you.
For what? Uh, you know, everything.
I feel like we don't appreciate you enough, so thank you.
Are you are you crying? Are you crying? Uh, don't do that.
Don't cry.
Oh, shit.
I gotta get back to work.
I I need to focus here.
We should all go.
All right, I'm taking care of this one.
But when we win this fuckin' thing, Richard, you're buying the next round.
Yeah.
Oh no.
We're with the conference, is there any sort of discount? - Kind of break you can? - Hm-mm.
No.
All right.
- Hello again.
- Oh, hi.
You know, that was really sweet of you to be so concerned about Dan.
He really has been through hell.
Well, it's the least I could do.
So how did you know Madelyn again? Oh, uh, long story.
Yeah? I have to admit, I'm curious.
You know what, keep it open.
Have you ever cared too much? People, are you ready? Are you ready for the ultimate tech startup competition? Let me hear it: Disrupt! Disrupt.
Hello.
My name is Saeed Jobrani.
I am the CEO of ImmediBug.
And we're here to revolutionize the way you report bugs on your mobile platform.
Happin! will revolutionize location-based mobile news aggregation as you know it.
We're making the world a better place, through paxos algorithms for consensus protocols.
And we're making the world a better place through software defined data centers for cloud computing.
A better place through canonical data models to communicate between endpoints.
A better place through scalable, fault-tolerant distributed databases with asset transactions.
And we are truly local mobile social.
And we're completely So-Mo-Lo.
And we're Mo-Lo-So.
We're Lo-Mo-So, bro.
We were So-Lo-Mo but now we're Mo-Lo-So.
No, Mo-So-Lo.
No You want me to get a water or something? - Yeah, drink this.
- Here.
- So we're all good? - We're all great.
I killed it.
Our Weissman score on all tests: 2.
89.
Right at the theoretical limit.
Yeah, all the edge modules are humming.
Uh, even on mobile.
They can throw anything at us.
Great.
Well, good luck.
I'm gonna go find my seat.
Um, except 3D video.
What? Erlich better steer them away from that just to be safe.
Where the hell is Erlich? He wasn't with you guys this morning? Rather than heating an entire room, HumanHeater is a microwave technology that can heat the surface of a person's skin instead, potentially saving millions in heating costs and helping the environment, thereby making the world a better place.
Judges.
Uh OK, so, you want to heat people with microwaves, is that right? That can't be safe.
That's a great question and trust me, it is very, very safe.
I've been working on it for 15 years.
I don't trust you and it can't be safe.
And even if it was, I don't think you could ever sell the public on this.
Thank you.
I think when people see the savings on their utility bill and when they see how it saves the environment, they will be sold.
Microwaves? Are you kidding me? Man, they are brutal.
All right, let's light this candle.
Where the hell have you been? Uh, there's been some developments.
You know how I fucked Melcher's old wife? - I fucked his new wife, too.
- What? Uh, don't worry, he's not gonna find out.
I left way before he got back last night and then I didn't go back this morning until You went back? How many times did you fuck this woman? The old wife or the new wife? - The new wife.
- Last night or this morning? Erlich, what are you thinking? This is kind of the big day today.
Relax, he's not gonna find out.
She's not gonna tell him.
How the fuck do you know that? Because she'd have to be crazy to tell him and I asked her point blank if she was crazy and she swore to me, no, she's not crazy.
- Pied Piper, you're up.
- Let's do it.
The microwaves only penetrate the top layer of skin cells.
I don't believe you.
It can't be safe.
Thank you.
I've been testing it on these guys all winter and they're fine.
Let me just demonstrate it to assure you - No! No! - No! Please! No one is ever going to buy one of these.
Ever.
That was HumanHeater.
Next up, Executive Chairman and Chief Visionary Erlich Bachman presenting Pied Piper.
Since the dawn of time, mankind hath sought to make things smaller, but until now, no man You son of a bitch! Jesus Christ! Everyone remain calm.
Stay in your seats! Everything is under control! Lights? I think he knows.


******************************************
N/A - Optimal Tip-to-top Efficiency

I'll rip your dick off, you son of a bitch! My eye! On behalf of the entire Disrupt conference, I would like to apologize for what happened out there this afternoon.
This man will never be asked to judge again.
I've just learned he's been fired from Oracle, and apparently his wife left him.
Anyway, I just got a call from your attorney, Mr.
LaFlamme, informing me that in his view this incident is actionable.
And in addition to holding TechCrunch liable for any damages, which may include the loss to Pied Piper of potentially billions in revenue and share value, uh, he be may naming me personally in a lawsuit.
So I would like to propose that we put this incident behind us, legally speaking, by sending Pied Piper directly through to the finals of Start-Up Battlefield, where you will compete for the grand prize.
- How does that sound? - I think that's One question, uh, regarding our hotel accommodations? Bam! Am I right, guys? I was just happy you got punched in the face, Erlich, but now I'm super happy.
I feel like I won twice.
I'm gonna disrupt this bathroom.
I don't think this couch pulls out.
I guess I'll get myself a roll-away bed.
I mean, you're welcome, guys.
I had to fuck a wife and take a punch, but now we get to go into the finals tomorrow without having blown our wad in the prelims.
We're trending up, boys.
We are trending up.
Maybe you're right.
But we should probably get back down there and check out the competition.
Ladies and gentlemen, Gavin Belson.
No matter what you may have heard, size matters.
Welcome, everyone, to a journey into the Nucleus.
I hope this sucks.
Nucleus will provide the most diverse features ever assembled in a cloud-based compression suite.
Massive functionality, inter-connectivity, and the simplicity one has come to expect from the Hooli family.
We're making all your files available for lightning-fast download.
Accessible from any device.
All these features will be seamlessly synced to Hooli-mail, Hooli-search and the full suite of Hooli computing power.
That's a lot of functionality.
Don't worry, he can't come close to our Weissman score.
Even with all this extra shit, it's like a fancy car with a crappy engine.
And now, for the moment of truth.
As you will now see, our Weissman score is the best in the history of compression.
What the fuck? That's exactly the same score as us.
Two-point-eight-nine.
That is not an error.
We are breathing rare air here, operating at the limit for lossless compression in audio, video and data.
Anyone who tells you that their platform is faster than ours better have good lawyers.
I hope you've enjoyed your journey into the Nucleus.
We have the speed.
We have the features.
And we have Shakira! Hola, TechCrunch! I mean, they just completely reverse- engineered our entire compression engine.
He totally sniped us.
- We'll be fine.
- What? They judge this contest on viability in the marketplace.
I mean, at best, we're a worse version of Nucleus.
I mean, they have 50 modules, and they're all awesome.
We have five that barely work.
I mean, we're still have trouble compressing Who the fuck cares? So the platform can't handle 3D files.
You know what, 3D movies suck anyway.
I could actually argue this Gavin nonsense is a positive.
Please don't.
We just need to really dial it up for the big show tomorrow.
Dial what up? He just ruined us.
And until then, we need to do what any animal in nature does when it's cornered, act erratically, and blindly lash out at everything around us.
I'm gonna go get in Gavin's head.
Hey, guys, I just had a thought.
OK, so this is it, right? A lot of successful start-ups launched with a different business model, and when they ran into trouble, they pivoted to something new.
Like Instagram.
That was a location-based check-in service when it started.
And then they pivoted.
Or Chat Roulette, OK, that was social media, and then they pivoted to become a playground for the sexually monstrous.
We just need a new idea, something that people want.
Right? We can pivot, too.
- Dude, you are fucked up right now.
- Yeah, you're pinning bad.
Well, I'll admit, I'm sleep-challenged.
I just spent four days trapped in a steel box out on an oil rig full of robot-forklifts.
So, that was hard, but I'm back.
I am recovering and I am focused and we're gonna pivot.
Don't lose faith, guys.
All right, look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
We've got a great name.
We've got a great team.
We've got a great logo, and we've got a great name.
Now we just need an idea.
Let's pivot! Let's pivot! That might be the last time we see him alive.
I think I'm just gonna take a walk and, you know, try and clear my head.
I'll see you guys back at the hotel room and we'll figure out what to do.
We're going to be poor.
Hi! I'd like to talk to you about a company called Pied Piper.
What does it do? Good question.
Maybe you can help us find an answer.
What if Pied Piper was an app that could attract rodents? You know, like the fairy tale? For purposes of extermination or to feed your pet snake.
We're not here to tell you what to do with your rats, we're here to get your rats, STAT.
Would you be very interested, somewhat interested or not interested? Which one? Which one? Which one? Look at them, all full of hope.
Pricks.
Oh, look, Kwerpy's here recruiting.
They just got 20 million in Series A at a $280 million dollar valuation.
- Wow.
- That could have been us.
It's too bad we already have jobs, we could easily go work there.
Yeah.
It'd be a real dickhead move to bail on Richard now, right? I mean, before we officially go under.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Total dickhead move.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Even though it is just a matter of days.
- And we are so close.
- I mean, he is standing right there.
- But I'm not a dickhead.
- No.
Neither am I.
Yep, just a couple of non-dickheads.
My dick and my head, totally separate.
You've heard the phrase, "Time to pay the piper," right? What if there was an app called Pied Piper that could tell you, to a statistical degree of certainty, whether you were going to heaven or hell? Very interested, somewhat interested, not interested? Which one? Which one? Which one? So you made some really over-the-top promises about Nucleus.
- Can you deliver? - Absolutely.
For me, Kara, goodness, greatness, these are not simply catch phrases, but, in fact, really the intention of Hooli from the beginning.
Gavin, you do not need to dignify any of this with a response! I can speak for myself.
Erlich Bachman, Pied Piper.
Was I brutally assaulted? Yes.
Did Gavin Belson here have anything to do with it? Unclear.
All I know is that the rumor that TechCrunch is all abuzz about is unproven.
- Wait, what rumor? - Thank you.
Why would Gavin have anything to do with this? Unless he had some reason to be frightened by Pied Piper and it's superior technology? This and all other Gavin Belson rumors are unsubstantiated.
OK, the alcoholism, the sexual impropriety at work, the impending crash of Hooli's stock This is the most ridiculous Exactly.
So why repeat the lascivious details, with which all of us are undoubtedly already familiar? Guilty or not, Gavin, I stand with you.
Care to comment? Let's keep moving, shall we? Yes, let's all keep moving.
Let's move on from this.
I forgive you, Gavin.
No matter how brutally I was assaulted.
Wow, Pied Piper sounds like a great place to work.
Oh, yeah, it is.
Pied Piper is the best, right? Oh, my God, everyday feels like I've died and gone to hell.
I'm sorry.
- He's a Satanist, so it's good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, fun.
- The point is, we love our company, and I don't have a problem saying that out loud.
- You - Love it.
We both say it out loud and I think that fact, proves that we're not dickheads.
So what we wanted to ask you was Guys? Totally between us, our beta crapped out.
The VC's did a full clawback and our Series A is DOA.
We're going down.
We have enough runway for maybe two, three weeks max.
So do you guys think you could hire me? How much would it be worth to you if I told you I had a GPS app called Pied Piper, tracking the location of your child? I can follow your child anywhere, and there is nothing you can do to stop me.
Most missing children are never found.
Interested, very interested, or very interested? Richard.
Hi - Hey suitcase.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
So you're Peter called.
He saw Erlich's presentation, such as it was.
And Gavin's.
So he wants me to go back to Palo Alto.
There's just a few other things he wants me working on.
Now that we're, you know, dead in the water.
Listen, I'm sorry you walked away from the money like you did.
But I swear I only wanted Peter to seed you because I thought you had a really great company.
It just didn't work out for you this time.
Uh can I be honest with you? I haven't had more than two straight hours of sleep in months.
I've had a cold for, like, a year.
My stomach cramps up so much I feel like I'm menstruating.
Maybe this is for the better.
Look, I gotta go.
I'm really sorry that we're not gonna be working together anymore.
Yeah, me too.
I guess I guess we won't see each other again.
Well, I mean, now that the rules about socializing with co-workers aren't in effect anymore.
Let me know if you want to grab a drink sometime.
What, like a "drink" drink? You go on dates with failures? - Constantly.
- OK.
- Uh bye.
OK.
- Bye.
You have any weapons or drugs on your person at this time? Why, yes.
Yes, I do.
Adderall.
This is a highly controlled substance.
Are these yours? No! Those belong to an underage kid that I brought to my house.
Yeah, sir, I'm going to have to ask you to come with me.
That's a kind invitation, but I have too much to do.
I'm pivoting! - Let's go now! - No.
I'm pivoting! I'm pivoting! I'm pivoting! I mean, what do we even present tomorrow? Honestly, anyone? Why do we have to present at all? What's that supposed to mean? If we are going to fail and be humiliated, why do it on stage in front of 1,000 people and a live-streamed audience? Are you saying we shouldn't even show up? No offense, but it's basically going to be a public execution.
Yes, and public executions are very popular.
It's show business.
We are not quitting, Richard.
Look, Erlich, I want to present, I do, it's just I don't know.
Jesus, are you OK? What? Yeah, I OK.
Yeah, all good.
They let me go.
- Who let you go? - When was the last time you slept, Jared? Absolutely, David.
What are we talking about, gents? We're talking about how I didn't get to present in the prelims, because I was too busy getting my face pummeled so that our team could move forward.
That's why we're presenting tomorrow.
And you know what? We're going to win.
Yeah, we're gonna win even if I have to go into the auditorium and personally jerk off every guy in the audience.
That's a lot of jerking.
And we only have ten minutes to present.
So So, we're fucked, aren't we? Yeah, even if he's jerking two at a time, there are, what, 800 guys in that room? So that's 400 times whatever the mean jerk-time is.
- The what? - Mean jerk-time.
I mean, it doesn't matter, but, hypothetically, time is equal to 400 total jerks at a two-dick rate.
Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a time, and then we can cut that in half.
How would he do four guys? He's got two hands, so that's two dicks at a time, right? Look, you have two guys on either side with their dicks, tip to tip, so you're going full-length.
Four, see? - Oh - From the middle out.
That does make sense.
- Like two Shake Weights? - Yeah, so what we're trying to do, hypothetically, is minimize time, which is 800 dudes, multiplied by mean-jerk time, divided by four dicks at a time.
Of course, Erlich would have to pre-sort guys by height, so that their dicks lined up.
Not by height, technically.
The measurement that we're looking for, really, is dick to floor.
Call that D2F.
- Huh.
- Oh, my God.
You know, if a guy's dick was long enough, it would be able to reach up or down to another guy with a different D2F.
The longer the dick, the greater the D2F bridge, but I would still be able to jerk it off in one smooth motion I'd just have to jerk it on an angle.
So D2F sub-1 needs to equal D2F sub-2, and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4, where length L creates a complimentary shaft angle.
I'm such an idiot.
Middle out! Middle out! Middle out! Oh, my God.
How could I? Uh Guys, does girth-similarity affect Erlich's ability to jerk different dicks simultaneously? Shit.
Yeah, I think it would.
Of course, it does.
Time to orgasm, or T2O, has to be the same for each matching pair of dicks otherwise I'm wasting a lot of great strokes on a guy that's already busted.
Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out.
So on a downstroke, you get a new one in.
So when you stroke up you're not wasting any energy.
Even so.
I think this is the most reliable metric for stamina.
Guys? Richard's been locked in here for almost two hours.
Do we think he's OK? Hmm.
You don't think he'd He did seem pretty bummed out.
All right, guys, let's go.
- The finals are starting.
- Up! Gilfoyle! Jesus! What happened to the door? Don't worry about it, Richard, is the platform up and running? I made a few changes, but yeah OK, tell me on the walk.
All right, you dildos, let's go! All right, talk to me, Richard.
What were you working on last night? Well, uh, I might've made a breakthrough.
Really, so everything is working? Uh, technically, no.
Let's face it, ladies, is there anything less sexy than when a user's visualization UX is completely sub-optimal? I mean, it's the worst, right? So we've gone through all the research and all the steps.
We have a solution for these problems and Zenella is ready to bring it to the marketplace.
Yeah, I get it, Richard.
You changed a lot.
Just give me the basics and I can roll with it.
I need to know what I'm presenting here.
I don't think I have time to explain it all.
What the hell does that mean? Richard? Is this the right build? I can't find the mobile suite here.
Uh, it is nowhere.
I deleted it.
- What? - Here they are.
- Pied Piper's here.
- Sorry we're late.
Richard, talk to me.
I can't front a band without knowing what we're playing? Uh I'm think I'm just going to do the presentation myself.
Wait, what? No, no, no, Richard, Richard, Richard, Richard.
Respectfully Respectfully, you're terrible.
You have world class showman standing right in front of you and you're going to pass on that? Release me, Richard.
Release the Kraken! - Pied Piper.
You're on.
- This is it! I don't know what you did, Richard, - but I hope it works.
- Me, too.
All right, let's welcome our final team to the finals of this year's TechCrunch Disrupt Start-Up Battlefield.
Presenting for Pied Piper is Erlich Bachman.
Uh actually there has been a change of plans.
Presenting for Pied Piper will be Richard Hendricks.
Richard? Sorry.
Got a little light-headed there for a second.
I set 'em up for you, now knock 'em down.
I don't understand.
I thought he made the platform better.
- He just deleted everything.
- Maybe he moved it to the cloud? No.
All The Carver's work is gone.
Pied Piper is a cloud based compression.
Without the cloud, nothing's left.
Gentlemen, this is likely the last ten minutes of Pied Piper, so let's enjoy it.
- Has he lost his mind? - He's lost his fucking mind.
Hello Hello.
Hello.
Um I am My name is Richard Hendricks, and I am, along with this guy, him, him and another guy that has disappeared Uh um We are Pied Piper.
A compression company.
Well, you know, in your pamphlets it says that we are a cloud based multi-platform solution for user-focused compression.
And we were.
Until yesterday.
But now we are not.
Uh, because you see, Hooli did everything that we were tying to do, better, way better.
Um Nucleus is built on the same engine as ours, like exactly the same, and their Weissman score was 2.
89, same as ours.
But the thing is, they built a ton of really great stuff up on top of that.
And we can't compete, so now we have to be something else.
Um well-played, Hooli.
Uh, OK, so anyway, we all know that the most obvious way to compress files is with Shannon coding, right? Top down.
Richard, they can't see that, it's too small.
- OK.
- Literally, hundreds of people here.
Oh, no, but I need Shit, OK.
Um right, oh.
Uh, so Shannon coding and then David Huffman came along, and he pioneered bottom up, and Lempel-Ziv with left to right, obviously.
And for decades, we used these codes to compress, you know, JPEGs, MPEGs, MP3s, zips, all that stuff.
But we all know that, so there's no point in talking about it.
But what happened was, last night I was watching my friends here have this argument.
About, you know, manipulating data And, you know, how many datas could one guy manipulate at once and, uh And I was just I was thinking.
Maybe it could be another way, you know? Something that I would call, "middle out".
It's up and down, back and forth all at the same time going on at once.
OK, well, anyway, I deleted all our modules last night, and I completely rebuilt our engine, from scratch last night.
Um Now, this morning I really only had enough time to do one test, and when I did, we hit a Weissman score of 3.
8.
Now, I know the theoretical limit was 2.
9, - but as you can see here - I'm sorry.
You scored a 3.
8? Uh Yes, sir.
And this is a universal lossless compression engine? - Text? Audio? Video? - Yes, that is correct.
Well, I'm sorry to interrupt your eloquent presentation, Richard.
But, rather than say anything more, why don't we just give you a file and we'll see whether this thing can do what you say it does.
Because if it can't, then we're done here, right? Yeah.
Yeah, that's fair.
So we can give you any kind of file and you can compress it, without degradation, at this standard? Three-eight? Yes yep.
All right, give us a minute, please.
- What do we got? - Does anyone have anything? - Do you have something? - I've got a file for him.
OK.
Andy Stafford here has a file for you.
- OK.
- It's a 132 gigabytes un-compressed, and it's a 3D video file.
OK.
Shit - A fucking 3D file? - Yes.
- Are you fucking kidding me? - Goddammit.
- Can we handle this? - I guess we'll find out.
Dammit, I hope this works.
Shit it's hung.
Oh, no.
Is it stuck? There is a time limit, you have two minutes remaining.
Come on, come on, come on It looks like it's done.
Wait, 24 gigs? What happened? Oh shit, there's no way.
It didn't compress the whole thing.
It should be twice that size.
I mean, 24 gigs, that's less than a fourth the file size.
That seems dubious, Richard.
Why don't we run a Weissman test for verification, see where we went wrong.
OK, I mean it shouldn't take too long, it only compressed half the fucking file.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have rewritten all this code.
I mean, what we had before worked.
I'm sorry, guys.
Gavin won.
We lost.
At least it didn't happen in a public and brutally embarrassing way.
- Thanks, Gilfoyle.
- Yeah.
Wait a second.
What's happening? There's no errors, look! - Five-point-two? How, how? - Wait, what? Wait, it compressed the whole file? That's the whole file.
It's just half the size I thought it would be.
Ladies and gentlemen, obviously we're going to keep looking at this to verify, but with a confirmed score of 5.
2, Pied Piper appears to have just doubled the best Weissman score ever measured.
Doubled it! Pied Piper, ladies and gentlemen! Let's hear it for them! Holy shit! Hey, I'm at TechCrunch.
This kid Hendricks and Pied Piper just ran a two minute mile.
We should get on this, now.
Suck it, Gavin Belson! Hendricks, you beautiful bastard! I told you we'd do it! Come on! We're not going to be poor! What happened? What happened? What happened? Uh, we just won the cup! And I don't think it comes as any shock that the winner of this year's Disrupt Cup and $50,000, like they're going to need it, is Pied Piper.
So Richard wrote the code? Richard wrote the code, yes, but the inspiration was clear.
Let me ask you something.
How fast do you think you could jack off every guy in this room? 'Cause I know how long it would take me.
And I can prove it.
- Nice.
- Thank you so much.
I don't fully understand it but I would definitely like to invest.
- Oh, great.
- Really impressed.
I really want to get you in front of my partners.
- Really soon.
- Oh wow.
I appreciate that, guys.
Well, hopefully we'll talk to each other soon.
- Thanks.
- Thanks.
- Hey! - Monica! Congratulations! You were amazing up there.
- Thank you.
- I just spoke with Peter.
He watched the live-stream via satellite and said he was "not unpleased".
Oh, yeah, that's great.
So I guess we're back to working together, huh? Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
It's gonna get pretty insane for you, Richard.
- Yeah.
- You're going to have more offers of funding than you're going to know - what to do with.
- Yeah.
You're going to have to grow a business, hire a staff, rent offices, get an assistant.
Peter is going to be a lot more hands on and a lot tougher on you.
People may take credit for your idea and try and sue you.
- How awesome is that? - Uh yeah, that's awesome.
I mean, if you thought it was crazy getting to this point, - you're not going to believe what it turns into from here.
- Right.
- I mean pretty soon, you could be managing thousands of employees who are all looking up to you.
Gavin Belson, he's not going away anytime soon.
- Mmm.
- But it's going to be amazing.
Excuse me a second.
Oh, Jesus.

******************************************
N/A - Sand Hill Shuffle


Ah! Fuck.
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
Whoa.
You okay there, Richard? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
Sorry, I can't really throw it any slower.
Give it another cut, Richard.
No, I'm fine.
I don't want to.
Maybe someone else wants to.
Who's next? If someone has to go, I'll go, but it seems very frightening.
You sure? You got us for the whole hour.
- Anyone? - Would it hurt your feelings if no one went? Man on P.
A.
: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the annual Stern-Taylor fall classic.
I'd like to start by making a toast to our very special guest tonight, Richard Hendricks.
Richard, after your perfect game at TechCrunch Disrupt a few weeks ago, we fell in love with you and your tech.
Look, we know everyone in the Valley is after you, and we know that you're probably going to go with Peter Gregory, but we'd love to have you come play on our team.
Let Stern-Taylor Capital Fund in on your Series A financing, because together, Richard, we'd be a home run! - Oh, right.
- What do you say, Richard? I'll I'll do what I can.
All right.
Have fun, everybody.
I don't know, man.
It's starting to feel weird letting all these firms suck up to us, even though we're not gonna take their money.
Richard, Peter Gregory hasn't officially given us the term sheet yet.
Yes, but he will tomorrow when he gets back.
If you can't enjoy this many people kissing our ass at this level, then I feel sorry for you.
Would you just relax and take it in for a second? I mean, we are getting our dicks sucked at the AT&T Park.
We're standing on the field of the World Series champions.
- It's totally lost on me.
- Yeah, I don't give a shit, either.
Hey! I'm Nicole Stein.
I lead the Growth Team at Stern-Taylor.
- Oh, I'm Dinesh.
- I'm Gilfoyle.
I love it.
So what do you two do at Pied Piper? - I'm the CTO.
- Ha ha, he's joking.
I'm the CTO.
Fuck you, I'm joking.
Okay, how could you be the Chief Technology Officer? I get it.
You hear the word "chief," and you think "Indian Chief.
" - but you're the other kind of Indian.
- Okay.
One, Fuck you.
I'm Pakistani.
And two, how could you be CTO of anything? You have to be able to organize, you have to be able to delegate, and you have to be I delegate you to go get me a fucking beer while I talk to Nicole.
George Silver, operating partner at Stern-Taylor.
So, what do you do at Pied Piper? He's the CTO.
That's Drew Houston.
We've been circling each other for the last 20 minutes.
Ooh, the Winklevoss twins.
Look at them.
They're like two genetically enhanced Ken dolls.
Do you know how much bitcoin they're worth? Oh, shit, they're splitting up.
Cameron's the left dominant one, right? - I can't tell them apart.
- I'm gonna come at him from the right side, try and herd them back together without spooking them.
Watch this.
Cameron! Cameron! - Okay.
- Well, well, well, look who's the big swinging dick.
Hey, Javeed, everything okay at Goolybib? You gotta ask them.
They canned me.
- What? - Yeah, our investors got spooked by a possible down round, so they shoved an acquisition down my throat.
Yeah, an acquisition of $200 million, right? Yeah, they all made out.
I had a reverse vest with no triggers, then I lost all my shares when they fired me.
I blew my whole signing bonus renting that house.
I'm looking into suing 'em.
- Jeez.
- Look, all I can say is, don't get fucked, all right? You take money from the wrong dudes, and you'll get smoked as bad as I did.
Just be careful.
Everyone is watching you now.
Yeah.
Totally.
I know.
Thanks, Javeed.
No, I mean they're watching you right now.
Oh yeah.
Damn it.
Where is that camera? Dinesh: I can't believe how many gifts we're getting.
Gilfoyle: Gifts I'm getting.
That Oculus rig is addressed to the CTO.
No, I'm the CTO.
As your superior, I order you to give me that Oculus.
You can't make me do stuff.
You're not the boss of me.
- Actually, I am the boss of you.
- Okay.
- Richard, tell him I'm CTO.
- Dinesh: You already told that fat guy that I'm the CTO.
Stop, stop, stop.
Please stop.
I have a ton of work to do.
You have work to do.
Maybe let's do the work instead of that.
Jared, we were supposed to get a term sheet today.
Have we heard from Peter Gregory? - Peter Gregory is dead.
- What? Holy shit.
He was the smartest, shrewdest strangest man I've ever known.
I can't believe that he's gone.
Can I asked what happened? Yeah.
He was in the Serengeti on safari - Ah.
- and he had just gone into his tent when a hippo wandered into the camp.
Oh, wow.
He was attacked by a hippo? No, I guess the hippo started to charge when the guide grabbed his rifle and shot at it, but his aim was off, and And he shot Peter Gregory by accident? - Yeah.
- No, he he missed but I guess the sound of the gun startled Peter, who ran out of his tent and Ran right into the hippo? No, the hippo was also startled by the noise and had run off prior to Peter exiting his tent.
So, what happened to Peter? He hadn't run in a long time, maybe ever, and you know, he just That was it.
- Oh, that is so - very strange.
- Very sad and tragic.
- Very sad and strange.
Richard: Wow.
See ya.
Man, that is so weird.
I mean, one minute Peter Gregory is here, - the next, he's just gone.
- Jared, it's Erlich.
I need you to set up all the other VC meetings, ASAP.
Line 'em up nuts to butts.
What are you doing? Monica just said they're still gonna fund us.
- We should just sit tight.
- Look, I loved Peter Gregory maybe even more than he loved me, but there's something you need to know here, something that Monica isn't exactly volunteering up, and that's all of these one-man firms have a key man clause.
- Do you know what that means? - No.
It means that now that Peter Gregory is gone, all the Raviga investors have the contractual right to cash out and walk away, which means that by the end of the day, there may not be a Raviga.
- Seriously? - Yes, so we have to prepare for that.
Now, I know that it makes me sound like a terrible person, but we have a company to run.
And do you know who the first person to agree with me would be? Peter Gregory.
_ Woman: And that is the very first spot in our new campaign heralding the upcoming release of Nucleus this January at CES.
- Any questions? - I have a question.
That was horrible.
I just got humiliated by a fucking teenager at TechCrunch Disrupt, and you give me this tampon ad? - A girl with diabetes on a swing? - I think she has cancer.
At least that's how I read it.
I don't care what kind of disease she had! All I care about is that Nucleus is better than Pied Piper.
Hendricks just left us all in the dust.
If we get this wrong, we could blow the business opportunity of a lifetime! Data creation is exploding.
With all the selfies and useless files people refuse to delete on the cloud, was created in the last two years alone.
At the current rate, the world's data storage capacity will be overtaken by next spring.
It will be nothing short of a catastrophe.
Data shortages, data rationing, data black markets.
Someone's compression will save the world from data-geddon, and it sure as hell better be Nucleus and not goddamn Pied Piper! I don't know about you people, but I don't wanna live in a world where someone else makes the world a better place better than we do.
"Data-geddon.
" Is he married to that, or? There's just been a lot of "geddons" lately.
That's true.
"Snow-mageddon," "Car-mageddon.
" There's that movie "Armageddon.
" Laurie, you wanted to see me? Monica, come in, come in.
I'm sure you've heard by now that I've been named our new managing partner.
Yes.
Congratulations.
Did the limited partners tell you how they made their decision? Oh, they looked at the portfolio performances of each of the senior partners over the last several funds, and my numbers were, objectively, the most favorable.
- Therefore, I was selected.
- Yeah, it's just managing partner is all about meeting with people and interacting with people.
You can sit down if you want to.
Do you want to? - Oh.
- Or should we stand? Uh, I whatever I'm standing - Okay.
- But you don't have to.
- Okay.
- Would it make you feel awkward to sit? I'm okay to stand.
Monica Of course.
Peter Gregory is dead.
Yes, I know.
On a personal note, his death is very sad.
But on a professional level, it's untenable.
I've been reviewing his files.
He was pursuing a number of extremely dubious positions.
Are you aware that we own a $30 million ostrich farm in Morocco, or that we are the majority stakeholders in three companies that specialize in invisibility? This box is filled with napkins covered with notes detailing Peter's conviction that genetically-modified cranberry fungus - would become the next cotton.
- That That one I remember, yes.
- Monica.
- Mm-hmm.
Peter Gregory is dead.
- Yes.
- We need to seem competitive, now more than ever, to our investors as well as to the industry at large.
Well, I mean, Pied Piper is probably the hottest early investment in town right now, - and we have them.
- Do we? But why then are they speaking to other firms - about investing in their Series A? - No, no, I just told them to sit tight for a day or two until we sorted things out.
It seems that that advanced a sense of uncertainty, and now we're at risk of losing their round.
This could jeopardize the firm and, by extension, your career here, Monica, as an associate partner.
- Well, I guess I was just kind of in shock.
- Monica Peter Gregory is dead.
Yes.
I know.
This is great.
Do you know how many times I've gone into these rooms with nothing but a half of an ass in my hand? We're walking in there with three-foot cocks covered in Elvis dust.
- Really? - Richard Hendricks? They're ready for you.
- This is a fucking layup, guys.
- Okay, let's do this.
Not you, Jared.
Now, with proper funding, we should be able to put together a functioning beta in time for CES and compress Nucleus out of the marketplace.
Yeah.
I don't know.
You don't What? It just doesn't seem worked out to me.
Well, I mean, it was worked out enough to win TechCrunch Disrupt.
Yes, and congratulations, you won 50 grand, but you're asking us for 200 times that.
Richard, look, we all know about your amazing compression rate, but let's not be naive here.
You can't expect to just throw money at an algorithm and beat one of the largest tech companies in the world, so why don't you rework this a little and come back in with a little more? Maybe next week? - And? - That was really weird.
I guess we don't have as much Elvis dust on us as I thought.
You see? This is why I wanted to go with Peter Gregory.
This is bullshit.
That guy throws this huge party for us and then acts like he doesn't even want us? I fucking hate parties.
And he's just, "Come back next week when you have more.
" More? More than 5.
2 on Weissman? No.
No.
Fuck that guy.
Fuck this place.
Fuck this whole place.
- Watch me fuck this place.
- No, wait! Wait, wait! Hey.
Remember when you told me to come back when I had more? And then I said I would? Well, I'm not going to.
Ever.
This doesn't count.
I'm covered in dust.
I'm a three-foot dick, and I've got half an ass to go to some other company who's never gonna put me on a Jumbotron or throw balls at me.
Bye.
Are you feeling unwell? Do you need protein? I don't know what happened.
Between Peter dying and Raviga maybe being gone, I just I just wanna get funded and build Pied Piper.
I hate this part.
Well, if one thing is for sure if we're gonna get any traction, I need to step up my game.
It's an email from Ron LaFlamme.
"Just got a term sheet from Stern-Taylor.
"They offered five million "at 25 million post-money valuation.
- "More than I thought.
" - Shit.
They were negging us.
- Negging? - Negging is going negative.
It's a manipulative sex strategy used by lonely chauvinists.
See, everybody wants us.
By shitting all over us, they try and bring our price down, but you shitting all over them counteracted them shitting all over us.
You negged a neg.
Richard, this could be good.
Where do we have next? Ross-Loma Capital.
Should I keep doing it? Should I keep negging? No, no, I'll handle this.
If they want to negotiate using hostility and rudeness well, they picked the wrong guy.
Well, you see, our main concern is how you're going to achieve escape velocity on your growth rate hit critical mass.
I'm sorry.
What What's funny? It's just that painting behind you.
It's awful.
It looks like harlequin Kama Sutra done poorly.
So, I agree, bad culture fit.
- I think we all just move on.
- Look, I didn't say anything about a culture fit.
No, I did.
Okay.
Well thank you for meeting with us.
We have a bunch of these things to go to, hopefully with more tasteful artwork, and your logo looks like a sideways vagina.
I find that to be racist, don't you? Okay, here's my concern Here's my concern Who the hell picked out that shirt for you? - What? - Oh, I see.
With the pants, so I guess it's a whole - thing.
- My wife picked these out.
Then you married poorly.
Do you care about Pied Piper? Do I care about Pied Piper? Well, of course.
'Cause if you do, I'm not seeing it.
In fact, what I think I'm seeing is the human equivalent of a "flassid" penis.
"Flak-sid.
" It's actually pronounced "flak-sid.
" Not a lot of people know that.
Well, we are definitely interested, but I think we need to I'm sorry.
Is something wrong? No, this is all wrong.
I am sensing a general lack of vision.
Your muffins smell like shit.
So do your ideas.
One of you is the least attractive person I've ever seen, and I'm not gonna say who.
Should we leave or should you? We just got offered eight at 40.
We're five for five, gentlemen.
And Galveston Capital Fund and Yountville Ventures called.
They want to move their meetings up before everyone else.
Hey, let me try.
I want to be rude at this next one.
Go for it.
So, with some proper funding, we should be able to get a functioning beta in time for CES.
And if you don't fund us, you're a fucking slut.
Ah.
What's that smell? Is that a fart? You Are you a farter? Now, can I have a pastry? Or are you guys gonna eat 'em all? 'Cause you're gonna get fat.
It's not your fault, Richard.
This is just something that can't be taught, so leave the next one to me.
I can feel a big one coming on.
- What are you gonna do? - I'm not sure yet, but give me room.
There's something inside of me that has to come out, and who am I to stop it? His balls? He put his balls on the table? - Right on the table.
- On purpose? I don't see how it could be by accident.
Richard, I just got an email from the guys at Midland-Oak.
Apparently, there is a line, and I crossed it The line between $12 and $15 million! Ba-bam! Midland-Oak's offer just came in.
Gentlemen, we are valued at - Are you shitting me? - Take a look at these term sheets.
There is a linear correlation between how intolerable I was and the height of valuation.
Hey, you guys.
This is Laurie Bream, the new managing partner at Raviga.
Hi.
I'm Richard Hendricks.
Yes.
I recognize you from your photograph.
It's very nice to meet you in person.
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we did that.
Gentlemen, I am aware of the degree of interest you are receiving from other firms.
I am aware that participation in your Series A will require a very competitive offer, but for numerous reasons, I believe it to be the prudent decision.
Now I am presenting you with this.
- I don't, uh - This is way more than any other offer.
Correct.
That is very much intentional.
So, I believe that satisfies your requirements? Monica will arrange a time to formalize the details.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Uh, thank you.
Yes.
Yes.
Congratulations, guys.
I am so glad Oh, shit.
She's my ride home.
- I'll call you, Richard.
- Yeah, okay.
Wait! Laurie, hold on! Thanks for stopping Guys, I think we're funded.
- Yes! Richie! - Oh, yeah! Erlich: So, I push my dick to the side, unbutton the bottom buttons, and bam! - Ah! What are you doing? - Shit.
Sorry, sorry.
Sorry.
Meet me on the side of the house.
- I okay.
- Okay.
Go.
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up? If anyone finds out that I came back here, I will get fired, okay? Okay.
- Don't take this deal.
- What? You are worth half that at best.
Oh.
Wow.
Thanks for the compliment.
No.
The credit to you guys.
You negotiated your asses off, but this is a classic runaway valuation.
What's wrong with that? Pied Piper will be tied to this crazy valuation that you will never be able to live up to.
If you don't keep increasing in value in the next round, if you have a down round, you are fucked.
It is the kiss of death for a young CEO.
You want to start with a realistic valuation and grow at a reasonable pace.
Okay, well, if it's such a shitty deal, then why did your boss offer it to us? Because she's as competitive as hell.
She needs Pied Piper to keep Raviga afloat, Richard.
- Okay.
- Look, I respect Laurie, but this is the exact type of thing Peter never did.
Richard, come on.
I own shares in Pied Piper.
If this high a valuation was good in the long-term, would I be standing here, risking my job? Don't take our offer.
Maybe go with the lowest offer you got.
Even that might be too high.
Again, thank you for the compliment.
Also I didn't see anything - in there.
- No.
Yeah, thank you.
I was gonna say if you had, you'd have to show me yours, too.
Umm - Okay.
- Okay.
Thanks for the _ Yeah, sorry about that party.
I was in kind of a bad way that night.
And truth is I'm actually doing okay.
- Good.
That's great.
- Yeah.
I mean, I could run the scenarios about what happened all I want, but I finally just realized there's just nothing - I could do, you know? - Yeah.
but I finally just realized there's just nothing - I could do, you know? - Yeah.
So I'm at peace with it all.
I was thinking, actually What if you had asked for less? - What? - Well, what if you could've gone to someone and asked for less than what they offered that first round? You mean, like, negotiating them down? - Yeah.
- Can Can you even do that? - Well, yeah.
I mean, why not? - Yeah, but I mean, I guess, technically, I could have - Mmm.
- Huh.
Yeah, I suppose you could argue that it might've been easier to hit more realistic benchmarks - and reach cash flow break-even.
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
And then we wouldn't have faced that down round and we wouldn't have had to settle for acquisition.
All that money - fucked me.
- Wow.
I mean, I don't know about - Shit! - Maybe.
- Look Hey.
- No, no, no.
We could've done a legit Series B.
Right? I'd still be CEO.
I'd have my job, my kick-ass house.
I'd probably still have my girlfriend and - Fuck! - Okay.
Why the fuck didn't anyone tell me I could take less? I don't know.
I don't know.
- Ideas come up and then - Fuck! I'll take a cab, so I'll leave you to it.
Thanks for meeting me.
Fuck! Richard.
Richard, I'm Laurie Bream.
I was inside your home yesterday.
Have you made a decision regarding our proposal? Uh, yeah, yeah, we'll go with you guys, but we need to renegotiate the terms.
Oh, I'm afraid that's untenable.
We're offering as much money as we can.
No, no, we wanna go lower.
We want less A lot less, actually.
We'll go with Raviga if you guys do not 20 at 100.
I think this is more reasonable, and it's my final offer.
Take it or leave it.
I was not anticipating this, but I think it will be workable from our end.
And one more thing Monica votes for Raviga's board seat.
Certainly that seems unimportant.
I will telephone your lawyer tomorrow, - and we can speak about the relevant details.
- Good.
Peter was one of the few who genuinely took action to use technology to help humanity thrive.
But how exactly can we quantify another human's contributions to mankind? Let's break it down into its three component elements.
I met Peter when he was thinking about investing in my company, Zetasphere, although I think he was hesitant after his disappointing initial return from Snapchat.
He came on board, anyway, and every month we would meet.
Peter was always an honest man, and I know that if Peter were here with us today, he would say that he was not disappointed in Snapchat, and he would forgive you, Lev, for your misunderstanding.
That's just the kind of guy that Peter was Warm, generous, and not disappointed in Snapchat.
I'll never forget the first time I met Peter.
It was in his mom's garage, where we started our first business together Manufacturing VGA graphics cards for IBM clones.
We never looked back.
And you know, the last time I saw him, it was at a restaurant, not a half-mile away from that same garage.
We talked as old friends do.
He asked me about Jackson Hole, I asked him about Pilates.
And yet something was wrong.
Underneath it all, there was an unmistakable tension.
A tension I will forever regret.
It's no secret Peter and I had our differences.
We let business get between us.
Now? Now I wish I could say I'm sorry for that.
It's too late.
He's gone, and it makes me realize the importance of forgiveness, of doing things with love and compassion in your heart, and not vengeance and competition.
I mean, we owe that to each other, don't we? And to him? After all, this valley is the place Peter himself helped build.
Where we come together as dreamers, all of us, to truly make the world a better place.
This is Florence during the Renaissance.
This is Camelot.
This is the place Peter himself called "the cradle of innovation.
" I will miss my friend.
Bye, Pete.
Maybe he is a human, after all.
Sorry.
It's from Ron LaFlamme.
Gavin Belson is suing you.
"Filed claims today that you stole Pied Piper from Hooli.
" Shit.
Gavin Belson is suing us.



******************************************
N/A - Runaway Devaluation

How can Gavin Belson claim that he owns Pied Piper? I mean, this whole lawsuit is insane, right? Well, let me ask you something, Richie And I need you to be totally straight with me Was Pied Piper related in any way to what you were doing when you were working at Hooli? No.
No, not at all.
I was doing quality assurance for mobile messaging.
It had nothing to do with compression.
They didn't even have a compression division at that time.
And did you work on Pied Piper on Hooli time or use Hooli equipment to develop it in any way - at any time, Richie? - No, and no.
Great.
And by the way, always tell me that and tell yourself that.
Because if you believe it, a jury will, too.
Oh, I I do believe it.
It's the truth.
Great.
That one was even better than the other one.
I love it.
Always say it exactly like that.
Yeah, okay.
Look We're going to win this, right? Richie, if what you just told me is the truth And don't tell me if you lied Gavin's got nothing here.
This is a classic intimidation lawsuit designed to freeze you until after Nucleus comes to market.
It's got all the usual boilerplate nonsense: "Breach of contract," "unjust enrichment," "breach of non-solicitation" in the hiring of someone named Donald Dunn.
Jared.
We call him Jared.
Changing his name to get out of it clever but irrelevant, because all we care about are the intellectual-property claims.
And we will win this - Good.
- but we're going to have to lawyer up.
What do you mean? Aren't you our lawyer? I'm not a litigator.
That's what you need.
Another lawyer? Really? Lawyers, Richie.
You don't want to mess around here.
A young start-up with an IP lawsuit hanging over its head? I wouldn't want to be a part of that team.
Well, but you are a part of that team.
I'm part of the team that team is on.
Yeah.
It's It just sounds really expensive.
Says the guy who just got bukkaked with fat term sheets.
Welcome to the business, Richie.
Look, wherever we're at with your funding, legal fees will be worked into the deal.
You've got Raviga.
You're covered.
Relax.
"We're out"? What do you mean, "we're out"? Was it not clear from the context? We at Raviga are out of the business of funding Pied Piper, at least while the Hooli lawsuit remains unresolved.
That suit is total nonsense.
Nonsense is not a quantifiable metric, Monica.
Risk is.
Funding any early-stage company is a high-risk proposition, but compound that uncertainty with a legal cloud over the company's intellectual property, and it's untenable.
And that is just the financial risk.
There is also a legal risk.
We could become embroiled in Gavin Belson's lawsuit for aiding and abetting.
And there is a political risk for the firm, but especially for me as its new leader.
I'm being heavily scrutinized from both within and without.
I cannot have my first decision post-Peter be one with such dubious fundamentals.
It's a rudimentary decision.
How am I supposed to tell them this? In my experience, it's best to look a person in the eye and deliver the information with warmth and compassion.
Okay.
One other suggestion Dress unattractively when you tell them.
I read a study.
The less sexual interest they feel for you, the less perturbing it will be.
It sounds strange, but it's credible.
May I suggest the The beige ensemble in which you came to work Tuesday? Things are just really different at Raviga, and I had nothing to do with the decision.
Guys, I'm so, so sorry.
Wait, so the company that offered us the most until Richard talked them into offering us the least is now offering us nothing? But the fact that you're so sorry makes it all better.
You guys will be fine.
You'll find someone else.
We don't want someone else, Monica.
The whole point of going with you guys was because we trust you guys.
- Trusted.
- We still have our 5% stake, and Laurie said that I can still sit on the board, which means I can still come to meetings Can I say something here? First off, Monica, you're not fooling any of us for even a second with your dress-shitty- to-ease-the-pain routine.
It's a classic chick break-up move, and you're not very good at it either.
You look great.
Yeah, beige is a good color for you.
You're a true autumn.
Secondly, who cares? We have a three-foot stack of term sheets from the top VCs on the face of the planet.
So the top one fell out.
As Jay Z says, on to the next one.
Jared, who's our next best offer? Uh, between the numbers and the reputation, that would be Coleman Blair Partners.
I'm gonna go put my face on.
Call Coleman Blair.
Tell them that Santa Claus is coming early this year, and he's bringing a big bag of Pied Piper.
Well, I'm going to leave this room without saying goodbye to you.
I'm sure you can find your way out with one of your two faces.
Sorry about that.
The guys are just a little emotional.
No, I I get it.
And look, I probably shouldn't say this, but there are a lot of really great VCs in town.
You'll be fine.
- I just - Just what? Just tell them that you're really excited to be in business with them and try to close quickly.
You know, while momentum is still on your side.
Well, it's gonna break a lot of hearts on Sand Hill Road, but congratulations.
We decided to go with you.
Uh, we were told that you were going with Raviga.
And I am happy to say that is no longer the case.
We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Can I ask Did you walk away from them, or did they walk away from you because of the lawsuit? Ah, that lawsuit we know to be frivolous.
Yeah.
Is that a "yes" folder? No.
So no pastries today, huh? So both Raviga and Coleman Blair Partners passed - because of the lawsuit? - Frivolous suit.
It's nothing.
Look, before we start negging each other - Negging? - It's a term used in sexual manipulation.
Maybe not relevant here.
We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Hmm.
We actually see this lawsuit as a positive.
We will win, and it proves that we have something worth suing over.
And yet Raviga, Coleman Blair Partners, and Wood Opal Fund have all passed.
We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Hmm.
You know term sheets aren't legally binding documents, right? Of course not.
They're just guidelines that people follow, unless, of course, they're pussies.
You came in here three days ago.
You were arrogant, condescending, and offensive.
Now you come in here, you call me a pussy Whoa, whoa, I did not call you a pussy.
I said that people who break term-sheet agreements are pussies, and that hasn't happened yet.
Thus I haven't called you a pussy yet.
You're in control of the situation.
Hooli has the unlimited resources to hamstring you until Nucleus comes out, at which point, they will be the market standard, and you will be irrelevant.
We're here to invest in innovation, not lawyers, so let me be perfectly honest with you.
Your behavior was boorish and juvenile You were rude, vulgar and uncouth.
You were course, graceless and puerile.
Obscene, insulting and ignorant.
Ignorant? You called me a shit-riddled anal wasteland.
You called me a chode gargling fuck-toilet.
We're really excited to be in business with you guys.
Uh, guys, I hate to panic you until I'm absolutely sure it's warranted, but Richard just texted me.
We got our seventh pass.
- Fuck.
- Fuckin' Gavin Belson.
All the VCs turned on us.
Apparently, Erlich used some pretty assertive vaginal metaphors last round, so it's been a bit of an uphill climb.
I think we're going to have to crunch our burn-rate again.
Even with the $50,000 from TechCrunch, we're not going to last very long.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no.
Richard said we were going to split that money, right? - $10,000 each? - I don't think we can afford to do that anymore.
Fuck! I just donated $5,000 to my cousin Wajeed's Kickstarter campaign.
He's trying to get an app called Bro off the ground.
- Bro? - It's a messaging app that lets you send the word "bro" to everyone else who has the app.
So it's exactly like the "Yo" app.
Yes, but less original.
Why don't you just cancel your credit card? That way Kickstarter can't collect your pledge.
Well, I would love to, but he looks up to me.
I was always like the cool cousin of the family.
You know what I mean? Wait.
Did you just say you were the cool cousin? Yeah.
Please explain.
Well, when we were kids, I was the one getting good grades, I was the one who was planning for my future.
I would bring gifts for my teachers, 'cause they worked so hard.
You know, cool stuff.
He was always getting in trouble, he got caught smoking opium in the tool shed, he crashed my uncle's motorbike.
And you think you're the cool one? Yeah, it's different in Pakistan.
I've never been, but I know it isn't.
Oh, here it is "Bro to Bro is a one-bit communication messenger, "the fastest way to speak your mind.
" As long as what's on your mind is the word "bro.
" Well, he's still shy of his goal.
If he doesn't get there, none of the pledges get collected.
I feel horrible for what I'm about to say, but I really hope he fails.
That is the first cool thing you've ever said.
You know what? This may not be an issue.
Richard and Erlich are heading into their last stop.
I trust Erlich can be diplomatic and pull it off.
A few days ago, I came in here, I did some things and said some things that I should not have.
Also we would like to be open about the fact that Pied Piper is involved in a complicated legal matter that could affect our potential value.
And that being said, we are open to renegotiating the funding terms to reflect that.
But most of all, I want to thank you.
Thank you for allowing me to come in here today and be vulnerable and to apologize.
Mr.
Bachman, I didn't have you come all the way back here today just to apologize to me.
Uh, please, it's Erlich.
And you didn't? Of course not.
I I asked you back because three days ago I sat right here, and I watched you put your testes on this reclaimed Brazilian Koa wood table, and now you're going to sit there and you're going to watch me do the same goddamn thing to you.
- What? What? - My turn.
- No but it's your table! - Yes, it is my table.
- Richard: Oh, man.
Please don't do that.
- Erlich: Good god! I think you should cancel your Kickstarter campaign.
- Whoa, what? - Listen, I love your idea.
- You know I do, right, bro? - Yeah.
Bro? Bro? Like, it lets you send the word "bro" to anyone else that has the app.
I know what it is.
You've explained it to me so many times.
I love it, but you know, I'm not saying Other people are, like, saying horrible stuff.
I'm supporting you, and they're saying, like, "Oh, he couldn't get funding, so he had to go to Kickstarter "like some charity case collecting money from strangers, "like a street beggar who sits on the ground, - "eats trash.
" - Really? Yeah.
Look, just between us, I was thinking about canceling, anyways, because we're way, way under our goal.
Really? Really? Like, embarrassingly low.
Hmm.
You know what? - That sucks.
- It does really suck.
But I think it's the right thing to do.
- Well, you're right.
- 'Cause you don't want bad word of mouth to kill such a great idea.
Yeah, like with what happened to your app.
Yeah.
What do you mean, what happened to my app? Everybody started talking about how bad it was and you ended up giving up.
I didn't give up.
I left to go work on Pied Piper.
So you're saying, then, that if Pied Piper didn't happen, you would still be working on your app? Even though all those people just shit, like, all over Like all of them.
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ You know what? You're right, you're right.
That's what makes you so cool, that you have the fucking backbone to say that.
- Fuck those people.
- Yeah, fuck 'em all.
- Fuck those people.
- Fuck them.
I'm not going to cancel my Kickstarter campaign.
Fuck 'em.
Wait, hold on one second.
Yeah, no, you know what? You're right.
Fuck them.
I'm not going to cancel it, and I'm going to throw a huge Kickstarter party.
I'm gonna invite everyone that I know, and we're going to put Bro over the top.
Everybody, this guy is the coolest cousin! Thank you for the $5,000, eh? Whoo! At least I have the common decency to shave mine.
Before you pull them out in public? So you're complaining about the guy's sense of decorum? Absolutely.
We live in a society.
I can't believe we are this fucked.
Guys, something interesting just happened.
So I downloaded Wajeed's Bro app out of curiosity and found it very sticky.
I've never felt like I was anyone's bro before.
The only people who have used that term with me were assailants, but, um, I started bro'ing people and getting bro'ed back.
This is my nightmare.
And all of a sudden, I'm bros with all kinds of people, including a guy from Branscomb Ventures.
Branscomb? That's a solid shop.
Yes.
So we bro'ed about this and that, and then when he heard I worked at Pied Piper, he got excited, he triple-liked my "bro," and asked about meeting us.
Okay, but does he know about the lawsuit? Yeah, I told him.
I mean, you know what they say, "Bros disclose.
" No one says that.
Wait, doesn't Branscomb already have its own compression play? Yeah, but not a good one, apparently.
I mean, they want to sit down with all of us, engineers included.
That only happens in a second or third meeting.
Technical due diligence.
That's good.
Okay, Jared, what What did you tell him? Um, I was waiting a bit to "bro" him back, so that I don't seem over-eager.
Bro him back! Bro him back.
Bro him.
We're not dead yet, guys.
Well, get some sleep, my bros.
I'll set the meeting, and, um, then I'll go find some hoes to prioritize behind you.
Are you trying to say "Bros before hoes"? It's sexist, but it's about friendship.
Middle-out is based on a completely new probabilistic model.
It finds long-range structure that's hidden even to domain-optimized algorithms.
I'm sorry, is Is this too in the weeds? Not at all.
Take us into the weeds.
Wouldn't you rather hear our go-to-market strategy? You mentioned something earlier about stacking middle-out on top of another compression algorithm.
How does that even work? I mean, you can't compress something that's already compressed to entropy.
- Right? - Wow.
Uh, I don't really get too many of those questions in meetings like these.
But, uh, it's actually easier if I if I show you.
- May I? - Absolutely.
Okay, great.
Here here I go.
Stacking middle-out is actually very real.
- Let's take - Do you have to pee, Jared? - Because I have to pee.
- Richard: So, when you unpack I would love to pee.
Down to the symbolic level.
There.
When you stack middle-out - They're brain-raping us, right? - They definitely are.
Shit.
All right, wait here.
What are you doing? I told you I didn't have to go pee.
What is happening? Those guys are never going to fund us.
We need to leave now.
What are you talking about? This is going great.
I mean, VCs are never interested in how middle-out actually works.
Of course they're interested, because they want to steal it.
This is a classic brain-rape.
- What? - We did it at Hooli all the time.
We'd schedule meetings with companies, so they'd explain their technology, then we'd use their ideas in our products.
- Like what happened to Yelp.
- Yes.
It's like when somebody says they want to go birding with you, but really they just want to get you alone in the woods, so they can take your binoculars.
Look, those guys aren't doing technical due diligence.
They're not even consultants.
They're a compression company.
One of them has braces, for fuck's sake.
Braces! Shit.
Dinesh and Gilfoyle are still in there.
Middle-out doesn't restrict itself to H.
264's two-dimensional grid or time-bound patterns at all.
This is great.
Great.
You know, they usually don't bring us to these things, and I think I know why.
It's 'cause we steal the show.
You guys are really helpful.
All right, shut it down.
Meeting over.
We're out of here.
No more pictures, assholes.
I could email you Why is this not coming off? No, you're not emailing anybody.
Damn it, Jared.
We were bros.
We were bros.
Wajeed: Yo, yo, yo, just want to thank everyone for coming out to this Kickstarter party for Bro, the app that proves that you can change the world in just one word! Actually, it's just half a word.
I know.
It's so efficient.
As you can see, we're just $5,000 away from our goal.
But we got a whole hour left, people.
So let's get those "bronations" going.
Donations are funny, right? I mean, why would anybody donate to something like Bro and not a homeless shelter or schools? Cancer? That's still out there.
Any of us could have it.
Food for thought which a lot of people also don't have.
Have a great party, guys.
You could donate if you want, but he's throwing away half the world's market.
You know what "bro" means in Mandarin? It means "asshole.
" You know what "bro" means in Portuguese? "Rapist.
" In Latvian, it roughly translates to "one who beheads the messiah.
" In Finnish, "bro" means "a baby's erection.
" In Urdu, "bro" is actually short for which means "a dildo for a man.
" A man's dildo.
"Fecal eclipse.
" It loses something in translation.
We don't have a word for it.
They do.
It's "bro.
" You know what "bro" means in Navajo? A really joyful person with mental disabilities.
All right, less than a minute to go, people.
And we're just two grand away.
Come on, you can do it, come on.
That's that I'm talking about! $500 from "Gilfoyle-underscore-Luci4.
" Where you at, bro? wherever you're at, you're my bro.
Looks like I got here just in time, bro.
What the fuck did you do that for? Do you know how this works? If you put him over the edge, we both owe him money? But you have to pay a lot more.
Wajeed: 30 seconds left! I'm effectively leveraging your misery.
Somebody! Anybody! I'm like the Warren Buffett of fucking with you.
$1100! Come on, bros.
You're a dick.
Only $1100 left.
I might be good for that.
- Gilfoyle, please.
- I'll tell you what.
You pay me $500, and I won't pledge anymore.
For 500 bucks, you save $5,000.
I'm not giving you a dime.
- Nine, eight, seven - Okay, I'm pledging.
- No.
Stop.
Let me - Stop it.
500.
It costs 500.
500.
- Okay.
- Three, two It doesn't matter.
It's not like he's going to make his What the fuck? Yes, yes, yes! We did it! Who was it? That's not how that was supposed to go.
Mika! Mika, I love you, you Mika! Who is that tall Asian woman? Some woman that Wajeed is fucking.
She was in the Olympics.
Huh.
He really is the cool cousin.
Even with the 50 grand we got at TechCrunch, we've only got a few weeks left of runway before we crash and burn.
Richard, if it makes you feel any better, I put that Branscomb guy in his place.
I dropped him from Bro, but not before I sent one final angry "bro.
" What do you mean? You can make them angry? You can make "bros" angry? Well, he made this bro angry.
But technically, no, The "bro" I sent was identical to the previous "bros" I sent, but I think he'll infer the anger from context.
This is Ron on the phone.
I gotta take it.
Yeah, okay.
- Hello, Ron.
- Hey, Richie.
I gotta bounce on over to my mind-body thing, but I just wanted to give you the good news.
I got you a top-shelf litigator.
Yeah, uh, we should probably discuss that.
You're gonna sweat me about the cost, right? Don't.
I hammered them on their fee.
They're going to bring it way down.
Okay, so how much? This whole thing is going to cost you 2, 2.
5 million tops.
- What? - I know, right.
It's like it's free.
I told you, I pay for myself.
So I'm going to need you to head on down to their offices tomorrow at 10:00 AM.
You slap an 80K retainer on them, and we are good to go.
Oh, shit.
I okay, I actually have another call, so I'll get out of your pubes.
I'm emailing you intros to the guys you're meeting tomorrow.
Later.
Hello? Oh, uh, hello.
Yes, uh-huh.
Sure, just me? Okay, what time? Hello.
Richard.
Thanks for coming.
What are we doing, Richard? Lawsuits and lawyers? You out there getting rejected by every VC in town? Neither of us want this, but maybe together we can find a way out.
Yeah, easy Drop the lawsuit.
You know I can't do that.
I didn't steal Pied Piper from you, and you know it.
Well, that's up to the courts to decide.
And until they do, you're frozen.
Meanwhile, my best engineers are working around the clock to get me a middle-out algorithm that surpasses yours.
And in January when we have it and we come to market, you won't just be frozen, you'll be dead.
You played your best hand, Richard, and you lost.
It's just business.
So wouldn't you rather get something out of Pied Piper while you still can? - Let me acquire you.
- What? No way.
Are you kidding me? We should have just done this the first time.
I know you thought about it.
It's the perfect fit.
You get my infrastructure, I get your speed, and I get it today rather than in a month or two.
What's the downside? The downside is that everything I'm building becomes the property of your giant, soulless corporation.
And what exactly do you think you're building? You're out there trying to get funding so you can hire people, scale up, roll out a product, IPO, and eventually become a publicly-traded what? Corporation.
We would be different.
I see.
I suppose once Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company, you'll seek out your competitors and help them.
Please.
Let's face it.
What is Hooli if not the best possible future version of Pied Piper? You think you're building something different? No.
You're building something that's exactly the same as what I've already built, except with you instead of me, but that's not possible now, Richard.
But you know what is? We could build something together, you and me.
Something great.
Something the world needs now.
Look, I don't have to do this.
I'm just trying to do the right thing here.
So what do you say? You want to know what I say? Okay, here's what I say.





******************************************
N/A - Bad Money

Richard: This is a good buy-out.
It's way better than what Gavin offered before.
And our packages include nice salaries, cash earn-outs, stock in Hooli, which vests after only four years of working there.
I mean, this seems like a pretty good deal, right? Hooli? You really think we'd go work for Hooli? What the fuck is wrong with you, Richard? What other options do we have? We need serious funding to go up against Nucleus, and we don't have that.
- So, listen - I will listen to the sound of you chortling on my balls.
- Okay.
- Richard, I'm an independent businessman.
Emphasis on "independent.
" And "business.
" And "man," come to think of it.
Count me out.
Actually, you're not being offered employment at Hooli.
They give you a full buy-out.
How big? Okay, maybe I'm not explaining this right.
I mean, when you hear Gavin Belson say it, it sounds much clearer.
He saying, rather than put us out of business, he'd prefer to just take us and make us part of his, um, Hoo Okay, that does sound bad.
But you just had to be there, okay? He's very articulate.
Richard, you didn't leave your drink unattended around Gavin, did you? Yeah, you don't sound like yourself.
I'm fine.
And for what it's worth, Monica thinks this is the right thing for us to do.
What? You told Monica about this before you told us? I don't know, Gilfoyle.
I guess I thought Monica would actually give this rational thought as opposed to ordering me to chortle her balls.
Guys, Richard's right.
It's a pretty good deal, all things considered, and Richard, I'd understand if you took it.
Thank you, Jared.
But Hooli was like an abusive spouse to me.
You know, like that guy who married Julia Roberts in "Sleeping With The Enemy"? It was dehumanizing.
But then, you, Richard, you pulled me out of the life and you gave me hope and you gave me a sense of self-worth.
Like Richard Gere did to Julia Roberts in "Pretty Woman.
" This is weird.
Every day here has been like that shopping-spree scene.
- I'm putting on hats.
- Okay.
Julia Roberts aside, are you guys saying that you'd rather me let Pied Piper die? 'Cause that's what's going to happen if we don't take this deal.
Face it, Gavin has us cornered.
He has you cornered.
Yeah, we can just go work on our apps.
Sorry, I'm not going to go work for Hooli.
Same for me, except for the part about being sorry.
And this buy-out sucks.
I'll have nothing to do with it.
If you're going to go at this one, it sounds like you're going to have to go at it alone, hoss.
Okay, so if I go to Hooli, you don't want your check? Of course I want my check.
What are you, insane? But I think it's important for me to show my dissatisfaction by walking out on you.
Richard, I'd understand if you took it, but watching you end up over there would break my heart.
What, like Julia Roberts from "My Best Friend's Wedding"? I never saw it.
Richard Hendricks.
What's happening? Russ Hanneman.
True pleasure to meet you.
Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.
Yeah, you do.
Uh, how do you know who I am? Good question.
No reason I would.
But I watched your whole TechCrunch thing online, twice.
That whole spazz thing you did That was fucking priceless.
So I called the Pied Piper number, and somebody said you were heading over to Hooli.
The guy sounded like he was either Chinese or retarded.
Uh, Jian-Yang.
Yeah, I don't know what that means.
You know, Richard, back before I blew up, I got fucked with, too.
You think you're the first guy to take this ride? You're hot, you're sued, then the guy suing you offers you a buy-out, am I right? Wow, yeah, actually you're exactly right.
That's what's happening.
- Like my ride? - Um They don't make it in this color.
They did it just for me.
Guys in this town don't have the balls to drive a car like this.
They're billionaires and they drive fuckin' Priuses.
Why? I think mainly, uh, just environmental concerns.
They're all lemmings, Richard.
Everyone in this town is.
Just look at them Lemming, lemming.
Okay.
I scratched my car.
Must be the rivet in my pants.
These are cool pants, too.
Fuck, that's a deep scratch.
That will not buff out.
Motherfucker! Fuck it.
Let me ask you a question, Richard.
- Have you ever had beef? - Like, with someone, like fighting? - No, the food.
- Oh, yeah.
No, you haven't.
Get in.
- Okay.
- Giddy up! - You in? - Almost.
- Let's do this, Richard.
- Okay.
Shit.
"D".
Drive! Come on, fuck you! Drive! Which is why I counsel any young founder today to pursue your dream not for profit or valuation or material wealth, but for the good of humanity.
Which is easy for you to say, being a billionaire.
Let me change the subject.
I have I don't care for your tone, Kara.
I'm getting a little tired of this bias against the leaders of our industry.
I'm continually creating jobs and helping people, and I'm tired of getting slapped for it.
I didn't steal the money I have, and I resent being treated like I did.
You know, there is a climate in this country that is very dangerous.
It's dangerous out there for billionaires? There's that attitude again, Kara.
Billionaires are people, too.
We are leaders in technology, in industry, in finance.
Look at history.
Do you know who else vilified a tiny minority of financiers and progressive thinkers called the Jews? Wait a minute.
Did you just compare the treatment of billionaires in America today to the plight of the Jews in Nazi Germany? Absolutely.
One could argue that billionaires are actually treated worse.
And we didn't even do anything wrong.
We're an even smaller minority.
There's a lot more of them.
These are facts.
Russ: So then it hits me.
We take this thing called "the radio" and put it on this new thing called "the Internet.
" And no one was doing it.
No one.
So we started hoovering up the deals.
Eat this, open your mouth.
Open your mouth a bit.
Eat it, eat it.
Don't chew, just let it dissolve.
Hold.
This is very hot.
Hold.
It just think it's physically impossible for it to dissolve in my mouth.
Now chew, chew, chew! - Ha.
It's very hot.
- It's good, it's good.
Good? It's the fucking best.
This whole place is.
You call this place and they don't know you, they pretend they don't speak English.
You see a white face in here? No, you don't.
Anyway, next thing you know, we IPO, stock triples in a day and AOL gobbles us up.
All of a sudden, I'm 22 years young and I'm worth 1.
2B.
Now a couple decades later, I'm worth 1.
4.
You do the math.
Okay.
Well, that's a gain of $200 million over 20 years.
Um, 16.
66 repeating.
Uh, that's less than 1% return.
Inflation is, like, 1.
7.
I think CDs are 2%.
So that's less than a CD.
Well, no one ever got laid putting money in the bank.
Am I right? Those bad boys right there, they're all you.
You gotta flip 'em over.
That side's done.
Listen, Richard, I want to back you.
You build whatever the fuck you've got going in that crazy, fucked-up, genius brain up there.
It's all up to you.
I'm white glove, hands the fuck off.
Let's make you a billion dollars.
Let's make me a billion more.
How's that sound? You're not worried about the lawsuit? Shit, no.
I got three nannies suing me right now, one of them for no reason.
So come on, let's do this.
Let's kick Gavin Belson's teeth in at CES.
And then when you're really worth something, I'm gonna take you back to those same spineless VCs who said no, and I'm gonna shove you right up their assholes.
Um, that's a very enticing offer.
And I wish I didn't have to do this Hooli thing, but I should probably at least "Should"? No, no, Richard.
Don't do what you should do.
Do what you want.
I mean, should I pay 800 bucks for that tiny piece of meat? Of course not.
But I do it anyway.
Because I want it.
Simple question, Richard What do you want? Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps? Or the "app-date," if you will? I will not.
Here's my app-date I was excited to work on it, and then I looked at it with fresh eyes.
Um, Wajeed was right.
It's really shitty.
I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
But I bought your pitch.
Yeah, you fucked up, too.
My app is still great.
But in the time that we've been dicking around with Pied Piper, the exact same thing have come out.
Guys, if I list you as references, can I count on you to say nice things about me? Be honest.
Do you want me to be honest or nice? What, did you get a parking ticket or something? Oh.
Yeah, I still can't see it.
Could you use your mouth? Uh, all right.
Just read it.
$5 million? Yeah, yeah.
You guys are not going back to Hooli, and neither am I.
How the fuck did you get that? Russ Hanneman? Oh, Monica, I see you got my text.
Are you out of your mind? Uh, nice to see you, too, and, no, I'm not.
You're putting your entire future in the hands of the man who put radio on the Internet? I can only assume that he mentioned that to you.
It may have come up.
Dinesh: Oh, this guy.
That's the guy? Yeah, that's That's the guy.
Does he actually smile like that with his upper and lower teeth at the same time? Monica: The guy is a joke.
How does he even do that? He's a boorish, pompous, womanizing douchebag who got lucky, like, 20 years ago.
And hasn't done anything since then.
Sounds like Erlich.
Sounds like he knows who he is and he doesn't apologize for it.
So he's a joke.
Who cares? This joke is willing to give us $5 million to fund Pied Piper.
And he doesn't own anything.
This whole thing is a loan.
Yeah, the demand note is structured as a loan.
But he does have the option to take repayment in the form of equity, and he does get two board seats right off the bat.
Which means you won't get rid of him, ever.
If you succeed, he gets a huge chunk of Pied Piper and if you fail, this lunatic has ratchets to seize control of the company.
Love it or hate it, at least Hooli is a real company.
You should take their offer.
I should.
I should.
But I'm tired of doing what I should do, and I kind of want to start doing what I want to do.
And what I want to do is a be a self-centered, irrational asshole that doesn't compromise on anything, at all, ever.
And when Pied Piper is a big fucking deal, Russ is going to take us back to all those VCs who passed on us and shove us right up their fucking assholes.
What? Yeah, I don't want any part of that last bit.
It sounded it sounded better when Russ said it.
Again, I am not good at quoting in context.
It doesn't matter.
I'm I'm going to I'm going to call Ron LaFlamme, and I'm going to tell him that we're taking Russ's money.
Okay, so I'm supposed to tell Laurie Bream that she is publicly co-invested with Russ fucking Hanneman? So you'd rather me sell my soul to Gavin Belson than you just having an awkward conversation with your boss? Oh, thanks, Monica.
The guy has calf implants, Richard.
How do they look? Gavin: Everyone on Twitter is saying I'm an anti-Semite.
- You were there.
- Denpok: I was.
And what I saw was an anti anti-Semite.
Hello? Did you hear from Hendricks? What do you mean he went with someone else? Who did he go with? Are you fucking kidding me? - Russ Hanneman? - That's right.
The Russ Hanneman with whom I am familiar? Yes.
That that is with whom they chose to go? - Russ Hanneman? - Yes.
He's a vulgar human being.
He's utterly distasteful.
And it would not be inaccurate to say that we at Raviga are now co-investors with Russ Hanneman.
- I tried to talk him out of it.
- Mm-hmm.
I did, but you know what? Peter used to say that ever successful company could look back at a defining moment early on where they would have died had it not been for the The courage and the tenacity and maybe the insanity of one visionary person who put it all on the line even though it seemed like a huge mistake at the time.
A moment where all the metrics and the numbers didn't mean anything.
It was all about the emotion.
It was about belief, rational or irrational.
And I think I hope that I just witnessed that.
I did not understand any of what you just said.
Oh.
None of it? - None of it.
- I will not interact with Russ Hanneman in any way.
- Is that clear? - It is, Laurie.
I feel very strongly that you should have prevented this.
- This exchange is now over.
- Okay, but I This exchange is now over, thank you.
Jared: Well, Richard? Firstly, congratulations on finally being funded.
I hope you took a little time out to enjoy this moment and celebrate.
I certainly did.
- You did? - I did indeed.
I celebrated earlier this morning.
You did, this morning? Oh, yeah.
But now it's down to business.
We have a huge amount of work to do between now and January.
I know $5 million sounds like a lot of money, but even if we set our burn-rate conservatively, it's only going to last 18 months.
Litigation wipes out half our funds right off the bat.
And we have to stand up servers, pay for financial and HR, pay LaFlamme, and payroll alone is going to be pretty hefty.
Did you see the hiring proposals that Dinesh and Gilfoyle submitted? - No.
- They're untenable.
Well, I need four web-app devs, two front end, two back end.
I need a guy to turn your ref code into a production-quality library.
I need two more guys to port the decompression libraries, do Javascript, iOS, Android, and I need a few more guys to build out our APis, so I need all those guys.
Ditto.
I need every one of those guys on my list.
Okay, it's just that there's That's 15 people each.
I mean, that's like an entire division at Facebook.
Fine, I could do it with 12.
I could do it with 11 because I'm a better leader than Dinesh.
Okay, great.
Good news.
I got them to cut it down to 12 and 11.
A positive step, but, um, we need to cut a little deeper.
Okay, well, what's the max amount of people we can afford to hire for them? - Three for each of them.
- Three? Are you serious? Can you just tell them? Oh, I have, several times.
But, um, they just kept saying if I didn't waste so much money at the butthole doctor, then we'd have enough money, but I pay for all my medical out of pocket.
We can only afford to hire three people for each of you.
I'm sorry, but that's it.
Okay, that's fine.
It works for me.
What? If you could do it with three people, why didn't you just say so? Because we're negotiating against each other.
No, we're not.
We're on the same team.
We want the same thing.
Disagree.
I just got you to give me three guys for a job I could easily do with two.
God damn it.
Knock knock, who's there? This guy.
Hey, Russ, what's up? - How are you? - I'm good.
What brings you here? I had to meet this lawyer and his fucking kid's sick, so now I have a few hours to kill.
Did I see a McLaren 650 S with the extra-trim package pull into the driveway? - Or did I not? - Yep.
So this is the team.
Whoa.
I'm just gonna say it.
This guy fucks.
Am I right? 'Cause I'm looking at the rest of you guys, and this is the guy in the house doing all the fucking.
Am I right? You know I'm right.
This guy fucks.
Thank you.
Hey, what's up, al-Qaeda? No, I'm totally kidding.
I'm diffusing the tension with humor.
What tension? There's tension? No, of course not.
Seriously, though, no beheadings, all right? Russ Hanneman.
How you doing, motherfucker? Aw, man.
I want to know what kind of fucked-up childhood this guy had.
All right, fellas, what are we doing here? Mr.
Hanneman, I am Erlich Bachman.
I am the owner and proprietor of this house.
So I can give you a tour of the premises if you like, show you where the actual fucking happens.
Nah, I'm good.
Listen, I don't want to disturb the flow.
I just wanted to check out the magic in action.
So I'm gonna grab a seat right over there.
Gonna be a fly on the wall.
I'm not gonna say a word.
We have a meeting that we were going to do, so maybe we could do that? It was nice to meet you, Russ.
So I think we'll actually save a lot of time if we got on the same page in regards to the budget.
So what I need from you guys is to I'm sorry, do you really talk like that? - Like what? - Like that.
I mean, this is this is my normal speaking voice.
Like right now, like how you're talking, is that real? This one? This this is real.
Wow.
All right, yeah.
Doesn't matter, go, go.
This is the same way as I was talking back there.
- Keep going.
- Okay.
Okay, so I think, actually, if we went back closer to C Dog! What's up, homo? - Our requests with an eye - Nothing.
No, you should come here.
- Keep going, keep going.
- Okay.
- That's more in line with - What's the address here again? I would just clear it with Erlich Hang on.
It's 5230 Newell Road.
Did you get that? Keep going, keep going.
- Okay, back to it.
- Get a fucking pen.
Go again.
- Say it one more time.
- The address is - Go for it.
- It's 5230 Newell Road.
Keep going.
Did you get that? I don't know.
This fucker.
Gavin: That little Hendricks prick fucked me over again.
I want this suit to be more than a holding action.
I want to win it.
What can we do here? Well, this lawsuit is going to be a protracted and time-consuming ordeal.
But with our superior resources, top litigators, we feel this gives us the advantage over Pied Piper Translation? Ultimately, the suit will turn based on proving that Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.
Now so far, concrete evidence of that is thin.
So thicken it! Gavin, your visitors are here.
Ah, gentlemen! And lady.
Shalom aleichem.
Thank you for coming today to open a dialogue.
Now if you'll follow me.
In an effort to hardwire sensitivity into our corporate mind-space, I'm having a scale replica of the Hall of Names at Yad Vashem constructed right next to the bike shop.
Richard: Okay, so No, no, no, no, no! It's got to be afternoon.
Afternoon.
No, no.
Bring him, too.
- Which Raoul? Lawyer Raoul? - Litigation and payroll are both capped.
SG&A, we still have a little wiggle room.
And we're going to punt Sir, you know you can turn the volume down on that.
Just on the side.
Richard: Where does that leave us? Um Let's go open an IPA, huh? I'm sorry, what? I couldn't hear you.
Someone was talking.
What did you say? Keep going, keep going.
Right.
Richard, one potential issue.
Our hosting fees could become a challenge as we scale.
Right, but we can offset a lot of that once we get a few customers and start a subscription-revenue model.
What? Revenue? No, no, no, no, no.
No revenue.
I'll call you back.
What? Why would you go after revenue? Because To make money.
No.
If you show revenue, people will ask "How much?" And it will never be enough.
The company that was the becomes the 2x dog.
But if you have no revenue, you can say you're pre-revenue.
You're a potential pure play.
It's not about how much you earn, it's about what you're worth.
And who's worth the most? Companies that lose money.
Pinterest, Snapchat No revenue.
Amazon has lost money every fucking quarter for the last 20 fucking years and that Bezos motherfucker is the king.
- The king.
- There's no revenue.
No one wants to see revenue.
- Go.
- Oh, uh I just thought that mainly the goal of companies is to make money.
Yeah, no, no, no.
That's not how it works.
I don't want to make a little bit of money every day.
I want to make a fuck ton of money all at once.
ROI.
ROI.
You know what that stands for? - Uh, return on inv - Return on investment! - No.
Radio on Internet.
- Internet.
Did you put radio on the Internet? Uh, no.
So everything you just did, do the opposite.
So you want us to take files and make them bigger? That guy! That guy is crazy.
I love that guy.
Uh, you said that you were going to be hands-off.
Is that still happening? Yes, please.
Do me a favor, make the right fucking decisions and leave me the fuck out.
You think Corey wants to be here? Corey, let's bounce.
Come on.
- Uh, Richard? The check.
- Right.
Um, Mr.
Hanneman, I think the bank had some issue with the check.
Uh, they said the funds are on hold for some reason? Wait, you didn't try to cash that check, did you? Did you try to cash that check I gave you? That's the show check.
That's the one you frame and put up on your wall.
You didn't try to cash that, did you? Um, so do we arrange a wire transfer or No.
No, you don't get it all at once.
We set your burn rate and then I cut you a new check every other week between now and CES in January, unless you fuck up too badly.
All right, hit it hard, boys.
This guy fucks.
You know, Russ, I've been known to fuck myself.
Well, he's the worst man in America.
And now he owns us.
Why the fuck would he have us come all the way out here? I don't know.
Boys.
Russ, what's up? Um I know you had asked us to concentrate more on branding and less about the The product, - but we were thinking about that and - I got it.
God? No.
No, shitheads.
Look! Richard: Oh, "I am Pied Piper"? Who is that? Dinesh: Yeah, how is she Pied Piper? - What is this? - Brand awareness.
We're getting Pied Piper out there.
Right.
But what exactly is the product? I mean, what's What's this selling? Pied Piper, idiot.
- I like it.
- Uh-huh.
Yeah, here's the new check I promised you.
This one you can cash.
Obviously, I had to subtract the cost of the ad agency that nailed that slogan.
The photo, legal, lay-out, plus the cost of the 15 billboards.
Don't worry, I gave you guys a sweet deal on them.
- Gave us? - Yeah.
Hanneman Outdoor Media.
I own the billboards.
That's how I talked the ad agency into giving you guys that slogan for only 30 grand.
Synergy, bitches.
Know what that means? Does it mean taking a stack of cash and lighting it on fire? Crazy fuck! I love this guy.
You fucking guy! Oh, and get this.
I found out where Gavin Belson lives and I placed 15 of these babies between his house and his office.
And guess where I placed the biggest one of all? This is the most hostile and aggressive act of provocation I've ever had to endure.
It crosses every line of decency.
This is war.
You better have something good for me.
We believe we have a way to win this case.
What if there were an individual here at Hooli with whom Hendricks had had a lot of contact? What if this individual were, arguably, a member of the original Pied Piper team? What if we took steps to present this individual in a light such that his talents were undeniable? Surely an individual this brilliant would move quickly up the ladder here at Hooli.
Surely he'd be promoted rapidly and repeatedly, no? And surely these impressive promotions would lead a court to agree that someone this brilliant who was there at the inception of Pied Piper, must be integral to, if not solely responsible for its creation.
It's all right.
You can come in.
Mmm.
So you're saying the more praise and promotion we heap on this person, the more it looks like Pied Piper was created here at Hooli.
Big Head! - Uh, sorry.
Sorry, guys.
- Uh, Hooli phone? I didn't even know the ringer was on.
No one's ever actually called it before.
Uh, hello? Mmm, nothing.
Why?




******************************************
N/A - The Lady
Thanks for coming in and sitting down with us.
We're really excited to meet a few good engineers to join the Pied Piper Team.
So why don't you tell us a little about yourself? I don't work before noon.
Or after 2:00 PM.
And I need to bring my dog to work.
Are you are you dog-friendly? Oh, yeah, you can bring your dog to work.
That's not what I asked.
Are you dog-friendly? Um Nice pool.
Can my dog go in? Yeah, yeah, we're very dog-friendly.
Is there a lifeguard? - Um - 'Cause my dog can't swim.
It says here on your resume that from 2010 to 2011 you "crushed it"? That's actually an old resume.
It should also read that I crushed it from 2013 to present.
So are we to understand that you did not "crush it" in 2012? There was a medical situation preventing me from crushing it to my usual standards.
So I had to take some time off until I was able to crush it at 100%, at which point I resumed crushing it full-time.
So it says here that you're proficient in C++, code assembly for multiple processor architectures, and that you are a cyborg? That is correct short for cybernetic organism.
I came into this world of filth and pain with a congenital heart condition, requiring the installation of a pacemaker, upon which I am mortally dependent.
Mmm.
Wow, he's technically a cyborg.
Yeah, yeah.
Makes the resume accurate.
Look, we all know that I can make a shitload more money working for some multi-colored Happy Town in a hermetically-sealed box.
But permission to be honest? Permission granted.
Granted.
I like that you guys are so weird.
Mmm.
Yes, we are the weird ones.
This morning, you put your soda cans in the green one.
Okay? That's not right.
The green is for grass and leaves.
Okay? The blue one is for recycling.
Go ahead and put those in there.
Yeah.
Very good.
The black one is for all other trash.
Do you understand? Yes.
Which is for burning? No, we don't burn trash in this country.
It's illegal.
You never burn trash.
Okay, can you say that? "I never burn trash.
" I never burn trash.
Yes.
What about garbage? Motherfucker.
Jared Patakian? You know, this Patakian guy is definitely on some end of some spectrum, but he is a full-stack engineer.
I mean, I'm sold.
Jared, what do you think? Well, he's qualified and he definitely seemed interested.
It's a programmer's market right now.
I think if we like him, we should pursue him aggressively.
My only concern here, and it's a small one, um, he's also named Jared.
Will it be confusing with two Jareds? If we hire him, I can always go back to my real name Donald.
No, that's too big a hassle.
We'll just go with "other Jared.
" OJ, for short.
I know a name is just a sound somebody makes when they need you, but shouldn't this much-newer Jared be "other Jared"? You should be flattered.
OJ Simpson is one of the most recognizable people on the face of the planet.
Was that Jared Patakian I saw exiting the house? Yes, we just interviewed him.
We think he's great.
He actually is great.
I tried to hire him for Aviato.
But then he took the offer, shopped it around town, and got more dough at a different gig.
I didn't care for the way that he handled it.
So I am going to have to err on the side of caution and say "Pass-adena," Trina.
Well, I'm sorry that that happened to you, but you don't get to Pass-adena on anyone.
We've got to hire a lot of people, and he was the only one that we all agree on.
But this is my house.
I'm on the board of this company.
I mean, I must get dings, right? - Dings? - Like in a jury or "Whose Line Is It Anyway?" Erlich, thank you for letting us stay in your house while we figure out what we need office-wise.
Really.
But I'm sorry.
You don't get a say in this.
We're going to hire the android.
He's a cyborg, Richard.
The son of a bitch is a goddamned cyborg.
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, distinguished guests, question What is a moonshot? A moonshot is an idea so big, so bold, as to be impossible until it is not.
- Magellan circumnavigating - There you are.
Sorry, I got lost.
But I think I'm supposed to be here - Shh! Come on.
- Not so long ago, people called the idea of sending a man to the moon a moonshot.
But we did it, and that is just the beginning.
No idea will be too big for our newest division, "Hooli [xyz].
" How long do I have to stay here? - 'Cause lunch - And today, I'm pleased to announce that after some negotiations and arm-twisting, the brilliant Professor Davis Bannerchek, a pioneer in robotics and founder of Somerville Dynamics, has agreed to head up this new division.
I give you Dr.
Bannerchek, the one and only man fit to be the first head dreamer of Hooli.
Also I give you the one and only man fit to be his co-head dreamer, our very own Nelson Bighetti, otherwise known around here as "Baghead.
" Come on up here, Baghead.
What? He also co-founded Pied Piper right here at Hooli.
I'm not sure I understand.
You are being promoted.
Being named "co-head dreamer" carries with it a significant pay increase.
Greater equity, more favorable vesting schedule.
See, but I really liked the job I had.
You know, I was perfectly happy there.
It was kind of the the perfect level of involvement for me, I think.
And also that other guy, Bannerchek? He he did not really seem to like me very much.
Oh, he does not.
And he wanted you to know that he moved four school-aged children and his elderly mother across the country in order to run Hooli [xyz] on his own.
He was very clear about that.
And he wanted me to convey that to you.
Have I done that? Yeah.
So what is my job exactly? Oh, that's actually that's up to you.
You can do whatever you want.
Okay.
See, that's sort of what I do now, though.
But starting today, you can do it in a much more significant way.
Enjoy your new office.
Wait, this is my office? Sorry to interrupt.
The photographer's here.
- The photographer? - From "Wired" magazine, for the profile they're doing on you.
- Sorry, who are you? - Your assistant.
What? Okay, Richard, last interview of the day.
Uh, Dinesh, Gilfoyle, this is someone you guys recommended I contact, Carla Walton? Yeah, we hung out with her a bunch - at the last S.
F.
vid/tech meet-up.
- Her code is fucking great.
She was head of engineering at Earcast? She was engineering at Earcast.
She pulled that whole system on her own.
You know what else excites me here? There's a distinct over-representation of men in this company.
Look around.
I think it would behoove us to prioritize hiring a woman.
I disagree, OJ.
We should hire the best person for the job, period.
- And Carla is one of the best.
- Right, let me rephrase.
I think having a woman in the company is important, but hiring someone only because they're a woman is bad.
I would never compromise Pied Piper.
Okay, just to be clear, our top priority is to hire the most qualified person available, right? - Of course.
- But it would be better if that someone was a woman even though the "woman" part of that statement is irrelevant? Exactly.
It's like we're the Beatles and now we just need Yoko.
That's the worst example you could have used.
I'm using VP9 ABR to reduce bits and using WebRTC to carry the bulk of the load via p2p.
So basically I pay for one tiny-ass outgoing stream and the user's ISP picks up the whole tab.
The users pay for all that bandwidth, not you? Wow, that could save us a ton of money.
Yeah, a shit ton.
And do you think you could integrate it into our platform by January in time for CES? Look, I'm not going to get in your way.
You know, you design the engine.
I just assemble the car.
I could have an alpha of that up in a solid weekend of hacking.
Wow.
Cool.
Plus I could count on one hand the number of people on earth who could handle sitting in a room with Dinesh and Gilfoyle all day.
- So - All of that.
- Plus you're a woman.
- What? No, I just mean we would absolutely love to have a strong woman working here.
I'm not a woman engineer.
I'm an engineer.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, no, no, no.
No, yes, of course.
We want to hire the best people who happen to be women, regardless of whether or not they are women.
That part is irrelevant.
Are you doing that interviewing thing where you try to rattle somebody to see if they freak out or not? Uh, sadly no.
This is that's just Jared.
I wouldn't know how to do that.
Well, I am aggressively unemployed right now.
So why don't you give me a call when you know what you want to do? - Great, great.
- All right.
All right, I'll show you out.
Yeah, lucky me.
I love "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
" So? So she's actually a bad-ass.
- Yeah, we told you, right? - We have to hire that person.
Are you shitting me? You see this, Richard? What is this? A spoon? It's a wide spoon.
In fact, the only spoon type that is left in this drawer.
I specifically posted a note on the refrigerator saying that the more narrow spoons be reserved for the eating for Fage yogurt by me.
Look at this the angle's all wrong.
Aren't you supposed to just tip that little plastic cup part up and dump the jam into the yogurt? How would you know that? Have you been eating my Fage yogurts? No, I saw it on the billboards.
Well, what they don't tell you on the billboards is that you can't get all of it out look at that! You have to dig it out.
But you can't dig it out with these big-as-hell, wide fucking spoons.
This isn't about the spoons, is it, Erlich? This is about Jared Patakian.
This is about me not letting you tell me who I can or can't hire.
Or maybe it's about the fact that you're the one - who's been using my narrow spoons? - Okay.
You and I both have to get ready for a board meeting.
Can we just stop with the nonsense? - Nonsense? This is nonsense? - Yeah, yeah.
You know, half the yogurt's gonna go unused because one quarter of the jam can't come out.
Thank you for hosting.
You have a lovely home.
Yeah, I do.
I like this painting.
- Is it sperm? - No, three commas.
Know what has three commas in it, Richard? Uh, a sentence with two appositive phrases in it? No, a billion dollars.
Yeah, I'm in the three-comma club.
You know, you play your cards right, you could be in the three-comma club, too.
But probably not.
But you could be.
Probably not.
There she is.
Say hello to tonight's fifth board member, - my girlfriend Nastia.
- Charmed.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- Huh.
You are Jew.
- Episcopalian, actually.
- Jew good at business.
Ha.
My baby's got some ideas about Jews, some good, some bad.
- Mm-hmm.
- Dad? Oh, hey there, buddy.
- Hello.
- Who's this? Another board member? Aspen, it's time for bed.
I don't want to go to bed.
I'm sorry, buddy.
It's not up to me.
I need you to cooperate, Aspen.
- seven, six, five - Fine.
- Four, three good boy.
Aspen - What the hell is that? Company I'm funding.
We call it the Lady.
I press a button, and the lady tells Aspen when it's time for bed, time to take a bath, when his fucking mother's here to pick him up.
I get to be his friend and she's the bad guy.
Undisrupted fatherhood.
It's visionary technology.
Okay, come on.
Board meeting, bitches.
Aspen, remember to take your medication.
Hey.
Just remember, Russ only has two board seats, so as long as we vote together, we can carry every vote.
Yeah, I'm familiar with the rules of a board meeting.
Okay, so 409A valuation report and new ESOPs.
Is there a motion to approve? Great, it's unanimous.
Approved.
Now we need to clear the equity packages we're offering to a couple prospective hires, Carla Walton and Jared Patakian.
Fucking cyborg.
Oh, um, Patakian is actually a solid engineer.
We'd be foolish not to hire him.
He's really good.
So all in favor? Sounds like a good pick-up.
Okay, board of one approved.
All right, uh, is there anything else we need to cover? Yeah, I think we need to talk about getting some shwaaaag.
What? - Shwaaag! - "Sha-wagga"? Shwag! What is it? - Swag.
- Swag? Swag! What is it? - Swag.
- I actually don't know I think we need to build on the success of our outdoor media campaign.
I'm talking Pied Piper mouse pads, puzzle cubes, fuckin' antenna balls.
Come on, I'm talking 30 grand.
That's like a hand of blackjack.
All in favor? I mean, first billboards, now this? I mean, as it is, we're barely going to make it to January.
Sorry.
What? I think it's a really solid idea.
I think we'd be foolish not to do it.
Cool.
So three-to-two in favor swag! Set you guys up with my marketing company.
We'll give you a killer rate.
Question who likes margaritas? Answer everybody! Babe, go out back, grab some limes from the tree, all right? Who likes swag? This guy, this guy.
We gonna get our swag on! What the fuck are you doing? You just cost us $30,000.
I thought we agreed to present a unified front here.
Well, if Richard wants a unified front, then maybe Richard should do a better job at unifying it.
Why are you such a dick? Why are you unable to listen to people who know what they're talking about? Speaking of Mexico, I'm supposed to go to Cabo tomorrow, but I got roped into buying these two tickets to the Muir Woods preservation thing tomorrow night.
Sean Parker's charity? That's a big event.
Gonna be a lot of members of the three-comma club there.
Am I right? Total asshole parade.
Anyone want these stupid things? Yeah, I'm down.
Uh, and Richard, no, you can't come.
- But Monica - No.
- Okay.
- Babe, I said limes limes.
She's honestly so fucking stupid.
She doesn't even know what I'm saying right now.
And until we get real office space, I guess we could just put you right here.
And we could put Patakian here.
I hope you don't mind sitting next to a cyborg.
Does he fart a lot and smell like onions? Well, he is a coder.
Well, I'd say I'm not getting paid enough to deal with this crap, but I so am, so You know, if it's cool, I'm going to get some stuff out of my car to dump here.
I know I don't start till Monday, but I want to get it cleaned out - before I trade it in.
- You're getting a new car? Yeah, yeah.
Mercedes hybrid.
- It's pretty dope.
- That sounds expensive.
- Guys? - It is.
Uh, Richard has something very important to tell you.
Yes.
Ahem, so, Jared has informed me that as CEO, I need to be able to answer any questions that you might have about Pied Piper's harassment policy and workplace code of conduct.
Apparently, every company our size has to have one of those.
Essentially, if you find the workplace hostile in any way, you can submit a written complaint.
It will be completely anonymous.
Essentially, don't do or say anything that might offend anyone.
Okay? Thank you.
That's the policy.
- Okay.
- Guys, um This is actually pretty serious.
I mean, we're all cool here, but we know each other.
So obviously, when Dinesh calls me retarded Frankenstein, or he describes me as AIDS lady, or Gilfoyle refers to me as effeminate K.
D.
Lang, I know this is a joke among friends.
- It's not a joke.
- We're not friends.
See, it's hilarious.
But, um, as we grow, we're going to be adding a lot of new people to this company, and to this office, and some of them might not be as amused as I am by such strong language.
Lawsuits happen.
So, questions? - Oh, uh, I have a question.
- Mm-hmm.
My best friend's nickname is Cunty.
- I'm sorry, her name is - Cunty.
And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while I'm here.
Okay, that one's easy.
No, you cannot.
'Cause, you know, I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch, and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty," then it's like, I'm not going to want to have Cunty over at all, which I feel like kind of violates my rights Yeah, um, it does not as a woman.
Okay, I'm going to have to get back to you on that one.
Her best friend's nickname is Cunty.
- Let's maybe get back to the kitchen.
- Okay.
Okay, okay.
All right, I got to clean out my shit box.
Nice bag.
Thank you.
Oh, look, "D&G.
" It's like Dinesh and Gilfoyle.
Okay, that was the third reference she's made to how much money she's making.
Hmm.
That's a $3500 bag.
How do you know? You have the same one? No, I have the fucking Internet.
You don't think she's making more money than us, do you? No, we all have equalized pay, remember? Yeah, me and you and Richard and Jared do, but not new hires.
It's the classic dilemma where the founders make less.
We told Richard to get her no matter what it took.
Even if she is making more cash than us, which she isn't, there's no way she has as much equity.
You don't know that.
And Richard won't tell us.
It's confidential.
I guess there's a reason for it.
It's so people don't get jealous and throw a hissy fit.
I'm not jealous.
I just want to make sure she's making less than me.
Hey, how do we find out how much she's getting paid here? I have a plan.
Hey, Carla, how much money do you make here? Uh, let's just say it's a big jump from my old job.
Right, but you probably got more equity there.
Um, no, actually I get more equity here.
- What? - Yeah.
Why, what are you guys getting? - Three points each.
- Three? That's weird.
I thought you got in at the beginning.
I have another plan.
All right, Jian-Yang, don't talk to anybody else.
When we get inside, don't talk to me.
- Good evening.
- Here's the - Thank you.
- Thank you.
And how will you be paying, sir? - Excuse me? - Your donation.
What's your preferred method of payment? Oh, no, these are already paid for.
We're guests of Russ Hanneman.
Yes, he reserved the tickets, but you have to pay for them.
Oh, okay.
And how much are they? - $25,000.
- Um, so but for both? No, no, no, per ticket.
Uh, there's no possible way that we could pay that, so what do we do here? Well, there are a number of other ways to help preserve the Muir Woods.
We do a volunteer clean-up program every weekend.
Yeah, I don't give a shit about the Muir Woods.
I need to get in there.
Sir, if you can't pay for the tickets, I really don't see how that's possible.
What if we do like a little in-and-out thing? I just go in there, 10 minutes, you know, have one cocktail, two, three max.
He doesn't eat.
He won't eat.
Yes, I'm hungry.
Gentlemen, I'm going to need you to move aside for the other guests.
You want me to email Russ Hanneman right now? You don't have Russ's email.
But I have his I have the phone number of the person who works in his office.
Does anybody have an extra ticket? My investor cannot pay.
That's actually not true.
Uh, I think they must have misplaced the tickets.
No, we have everyone's tickets here.
Can you please check? Erlich Bachman? E-R-I-C-H - That's not at all how it's spelled here.
- Let's go, Jian.
Have a nice night.
Thank you.
Next.
- Excuse me, do you have a ticket? - God damn it! - Jian-Yang, come here! - Do you have a ticket? Hey, Jian-Yang, how how was last night? It was sad.
Erlich, he promised me dinner with a big meat.
Big meat? - Big meet people.
- Meet people? Then people say, "No, you can't come in.
" Wait, so you guys didn't get in? We went to Taco Bell.
Erlich, he started crying in Taco Bell.
He tried to blame the taco sauce.
- Richard? - Yes.
- OJ says you wanted to see me? - Yeah.
Um, I don't want to say this any of this, at all, but several employees have lodged a complaint against you.
- For what? - Um for making this a hostile workplace.
By, quote, "repeatedly rubbing our fucking faces in the fact that Richard Hendricks is a pussy who gave a new hire more than us.
" Mm-hmm.
Interesting.
And which two of the several lodged a complaint? Actually, our policy guarantees anonymity, so I can't tell you that.
Look, you and I both know how much you make.
- Are you fucking with them? - Yeah, of course I'm fucking with them.
I bought a fake Dolce & Gabbana bag at a swap meet to piss them off and apparently it did.
And I lied and said I was getting a Mercedes.
Oh, I also left a fake credit-card statement open on my screen, - 'cause I thought they'd see it.
Did they see it? - They saw it.
- Yeah, sweet.
- Carla.
Okay, all right, but what I used to do to fuck with them involved gay porn and Photoshop, so I don't think that would be cool after OJ's big harassment speech.
Huh.
So in effect, the policy worked.
Well, I can we not do any of it? It just that they're getting really pissed and it's really distracting.
All right.
- No more Cunty.
- Terrific.
- That's really good.
- Cunty's done.
Great.
But you said it again, but maybe that's the last time.
Cunty's done.
I'm gonna call you OJ, though.
- Yeah, that's fine.
- That's for good.
Yeah, because in my head, I change the meaning from "Other Jared" to "Original Jared," so now it's a compliment.
If I have to, I'm going to keep my fucking "Star Blazer" VHS tapes in my room! It doesn't take an IQ of nine to know they should remain alphabetized.
I want to watch a specific episode.
And it's not like they're on fucking DVD! Hey, um, Erlich, I just want to say this is your house and you've been really cool letting us stay here for all this time, and as soon as we get our office space, we'll be out of your way.
And how soon is that going to be? Soon.
And look, I realize it's not fair that I bring someone into your house that you don't want here, so I will call the cyborg and I will rescind the offer.
No, Richard, I've been thinking, the cyborg is a solid coder.
You should hire him.
It's fine, I'll get someone else.
Don't be stupid, Richard.
You need a full working beta up in the next few months.
Just hire the guy.
I'm not being stupid, okay? I'm not going to hire him.
And frankly, I'm not going to let you bully me into doing it.
Would you look at yourself? You're still not fucking listening to me.
I'm trying to respect you, asshole.
If you want to respect me, then just hire the piece of shit.
Don't act like a moron.
You're not going to kick Nucleus' ass acting like a fucking moron.
You don't get to tell me how I respect you, okay? I can respect you however the fuck I want.
What are you doing? I'm respecting you.
Jared, hey, it's Richard Hendricks from Pied Piper.
Yeah, uh, bad news.
We're not gonna What? What's that? Where? Okay, well, cyborg, fuck you, you fuckin' - Metal-dick piece of shit.
- Metal-dick piece of shit.
What happened? He, uh, he took another job from Russ fucking Hanneman.
- What? - Yeah.
Apparently, I said so much nice shit about him in the board meeting, Russ offered him a job at one of his other fucking companies for a lot more money.
Our own investor poached him.
And he went? Fucking cyborg.
Richard! You need to come see this.
What event could this possibly be used at? Are you happy? Not really.
They used the old logo.
Do you smell something burning? God damn it! Jian-Yang!



******************************************
N/A - Server Space
Damn it.
Again? Let me ask you something, Richard.
You sure it's not urine and you're not just wetting the bed? Yeah, I'm sure.
It's it's not.
It's just sweat.
Well, then the medical term for what you have is "night sweats.
" Okay.
But night sweats can be a precursor to bed-wetting, and that is very serious.
How serious? - Like, uh, cancer? - No! It's embarrassing.
I mean, you're a grown man, Richard.
Come on.
That's what children do.
But I'm not wetting the bed.
Yet! How's your stress level been? Uh, it's gotten worse.
Um, I have to get a working beta of my platform ready in time for January.
I just took money from a guy who is a nightmare.
I hired six new people.
We're going to spend a ton of money on new offices.
It's like every second, there is a new issue that I have to solve.
I am stressed as hell.
Richard, currently, your stress level is here.
And that's night-sweats level.
Now if you're not careful and you let it go up, bed-wetting.
I love these walls.
You know what it is? They're exposed brick.
Why would anyone ever hide brick? Did you see the conference nook? Just think of the conferences we could have in this nook.
Oh, yeah.
I mean, this is really expensive.
So, um, what did the doctor say? Uh, it's nothing.
It's just stress-related night sweats.
- I'll be fine.
- That's good to hear.
- Are you relieved? - I would have been if that idiot hadn't have mentioned something about how it can lead to, uh, bed-wetting.
I'm just trying not to think about it.
Good, don't.
Definitely.
Because just thinking about it would probably stress you out - enough to make it happen - Stop! Would you Don't say "stress.
" I just said that I was trying not to think about it.
Well, Richard, personal management is a big part of being a CEO.
You think working here might help? Actually, uh, yeah.
I think it would.
But can we afford it? Well, this is an investment in your mental health.
Richard, I mean, can you put a dollar value on not wetting your bed? Ahh, don't.
If you want this, Richard, even with the money we wasted on swag and billboards, I think I can make the numbers work.
It's your call.
Hey, guys? Um, this is Yelena.
She got off the elevator at the wrong floor because her modeling agency is upstairs.
Richard? - Yeah.
- Please? Primarily for other reasons, but, uh, yes! Yeah, sure.
Uh, we're gonna take it.
We're take We're taking it.
- Take? Oh.
- I'm gonna hug you.
No.
All right, this one's ready to go out to the truck.
Great.
Take it out.
Okay, you know what? I said we should hire movers.
I don't do this kind of stuff.
I work with my mind, not with my hands.
In Pakistan, we had servants who did this.
It wasn't a big deal.
We didn't pay them very much and they were very happy.
I'll take out your box of tampons.
It's good for the soul.
Interesting pitch.
I will admit, I have never heard a Christian-oriented riff on dog-sharing.
But Christianity is borderline illegal in Northern California.
Also, how would you scale? Well, we could expand from sharing dogs to other types of pets - Pot-bellied pigs, ferrets - I'm gonna stop you right there.
You do know that ferrets are illegal in the state of California? Hmm? No.
Well, then I suppose you also don't know that pot-bellied pigs have been wildly unfashionable since 2005.
Owning a pot-bellied pig is frowned upon almost as much as being a Christian.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Good day.
And technically, I'm not passing on Dog Dammit.
I'm just not saying yes.
But who knows? The Lord works in mysterious ways.
I don't have to tell you that.
Richard, do you have a moment? I'd like to present you something.
Okay, what's up? - What are you doing? - Bowing.
The Japanese have the most advanced business culture in the world.
I am showing you respect by using their traditions.
And traditionally, you give a gift on important occasions, such as the graduating of an incubee.
"Incubee"? Is that a word? Of course it is.
One who's been incubated.
The inhabitant of an incubator.
Okay.
Okay.
Now you bow.
I'd really rather not.
Richard, I need you to bow.
- To the waist.
- To the waist? Okay.
Now I hand this to you, and it is customary for you to politely refuse and weakly say that you are not worthy.
Erlich, I really don't have time for this.
That's perfect.
Here you go.
Good.
Oh, wow.
Japanese coin.
Lowest denomination.
Wow.
Is this a kimono? - Well, try it on.
- Uh, thank you, Erlich.
Sore wa meiyodeshita.
According to Google Translate, that means, "It has been an honor.
" Yeah, all right.
Thank you.
Thanks.
I'm still packing up, so I don't want to damage it.
Eh, eh, traditionally it's rolled.
Okay.
Wikipedia.
Thanks, Erlich.
I'll get you something later.
Oh, little kohai, you've already given me a gift.
Hi.
Hey.
Noah from next door.
Oh, hey.
Richard.
Moving out? Uh, yeah, some of us are, sort of.
Well, I'd be lying to say I was sad to see you go.
Okay.
Nothing personal.
You seem like nice guys, just houses full of renters aren't great for property values.
Yeah, that makes sense.
This neighborhood is mostly families.
Okay.
Well, we're moving out, so People with pets, you know? Mm-hmm.
- Well, good luck.
- You too.
- What? - You, too.
- Hey, Richard? - Oh, hey, Jared.
Richard, the hosting company that was going to be renting us server space just dropped their bid.
Okay, well, let's just get servers from some other provider.
Well, I just contacted five other web services companies, and they're all denying us.
I think I know what might be happening here.
All of them Rackspace, Softlayer, Amazon.
I mean, they can't afford to lose Hooli's business.
So Gavin Belson can just pick up the phone and make us radioactive to every single web-hosting service? It's how these guys operate.
I mean, when Bill Gates got married on Lanai, he rented every helicopter on the Hawaiian islands so that paparazzi couldn't use them to fly over.
Although in that case, it was a positive, because now you can imagine that wedding however you want.
- What? - Jared? Our entire platform is web-based.
We need servers for that.
What the fuck are we going to do? I know what the fuck we're going to do.
But you're not going to like it.
We build our own servers.
Gilfoyle, servers are essentially a utility.
I mean, you wouldn't dig a well for water or build a generator for power.
I think we should dig our own well and build our own generator.
I also think we should store a year's worth of food and ammunition in a blast cellar.
But we don't.
So good luck when the shit hits the fan.
Look, Richard, we're about precision, about shaving yoctoseconds off latency at every layer in the stack.
If we rent from a public cloud, we're using servers that are by definition generic and unpredictable.
Yeah, but we're already up against a serious deadline.
I mean, how long is building our own servers going to set us back? If I busted my ass? I could stand them up inside a week right here in the house.
Look, Richard, truth is, this is a huge positive.
I tried running the platform on my old Bitcoin rig? At 5200 gigaflops, your algorithm flies compared to normal CPUs.
No host could match the config that I built here in the house.
Oh, and also, we don't seem to have a choice.
But that would cost a ton.
And we don't have that kind of money just lying around.
It seems as though we do have that kind of money just lying around.
But that's for the office space.
- Was it? - No, no, no, no! Jared, we already signed the lease.
It's too late, right? We can't break the lease.
I mean, we haven't given them the check yet.
- Here it is.
- I could go mail it right now.
In this market, they could probably find another tenant in a day.
I doubt there would be an issue.
Fuck! Richard, please? It's servers or offices, Richard.
We can't afford both.
Damn it, I don't know what to do.
Well, then it's a good thing It's a good thing that I'm here, isn't it? As much as I hate to agree with Gilfoyle, he's right You have but one option.
Stay here and build the servers.
Are you sure? Because I've got Carla and five other coders starting over the next few weeks.
Well, it's going to get a little cozy in here, but I'll endure for your sake.
What about all your other "incubees"? I've heard quite a few exciting pitches over the last week, but I'll be forced to forgo those opportunities because of your mediocrity.
You see, Richard, when I invited you into my incubator, I promised to get you ready for the outside world.
But I failed to do that.
I wouldn't trust you out there in the real world as far as I could throw you.
And to be honest, I could probably throw you all the way across the front yard.
Okay, but I don't want to stay here.
I don't want you to either, Richard.
So it's agreed.
Welcome home, fellas.
Should we smoke some pot to celebrate? Gavin, thank you for coming.
I am certain that once you witness firsthand what Mr.
Bighetti is up to, you will see that he is worthless around here.
Worth is a relative thing.
Yes, but worthlessness is not.
It is absolute.
People add value to this company in many different ways.
Of course, but look at this.
Bighetti has his team wasting valuable resources - on a potato canon.
- Four, three, two, one.
- Heads up! - Heads! Shit.
You see what your brightest minds are being wasted on? Launching potatoes.
- What the fuck? - Sorry.
Perhaps they're developing it as a non-lethal form of crowd control.
I actually think that it could kill somebody.
But even so, compared to what my team has accomplished in a matter of days, I Come here, I want you to meet somebody.
All right, I've got a good feeling about this one.
One more time.
Everybody ready? Fire! Oh, shit! You okay? Sorry.
Shit.
This is Kiko.
Kiko was rescued after a Nicaraguan landmine severed both his arms.
My team, using technology developed at Somerville, was able to devise an array of sensors that can non-invasively detect signals from the neurons in the motor cortex in the brain.
So without surgery, we have given Kiko the gift of a usable prosthetic appendage.
What's he doing? What Kiko chooses to do with the technology is not important.
What's important here is that, in spite of what it may seem like on the surface, building a device that is capable of this is a remarkable scientific achievement.
And what you're looking at is really a testament to my team and to my leadership, and I just I feel that I'm going to have to insist that Bighetti be removed if I continue here.
Davis, there are a lot of forces at work here.
There's a lot at play that you are not privy to.
Please do not question how I choose to run my company.
Of course, I just have to think that both of our interests would be better served if Bighettwas not What is he doing now? Oh, God.
Again, I have to stress that what the monkey chooses to do with the technology is not necessarily an indictment of the technology itself.
Gavin, please! Oh! Okay.
So I'll put 80 GPUs on racks against that wall.
We'll have three main cabinets in the center.
I'll try and pull 220-volt power from the washer/dryer for all the cooling units.
So you'll need this entire space then? Yep.
All right.
- I'll move my things.
- What? It's okay, I travel light.
I'll have it all in my car in no time.
Wait, Jared, uh are you living here in the garage? Indeed I am.
High on the hog.
Jesus Christ, poor fucker.
Sleeping out there with the rodents.
Hey, I keep a clean garage.
There are no rodents out there.
How can you guarantee there are no rodents living there when you didn't even know Jared was living there? I need all rodents and Jareds out of the garage.
I need the space.
Do we have any extra power strips? There's not a lot of outlets out there.
There are a lot of dudes playing foosball, loudly.
I'll take care of that.
Say no more.
Jian-Yang! I need all of your guys out of there, and the foosball table.
Those not my guys.
They're always around.
Who are they? Friends of friends.
They're friends of your Mother fuck! Guys, look, Jared gave up his own apartment so he could take less salary and save the company money.
I mean, Erlich, can he just stay here? Once again, because of your poor managerial skills, I've been hoisted upon my own petard.
Yes, he can stay here.
Great.
So, um, which room can he stay in? Well, he's not staying in mine.
I sleep dick-up.
Okay, so then Uh, not it.
Okay.
- Not a chance in hell.
- All right.
Ahem.
Fuck.
Oh, shit.
'Morning, roomie.
I made you a half-caff.
Oh.
- Richard.
- Yeah.
I, um, I sweated through my sheets again.
You sweated? You sure you didn't Yes, I'm sure.
It's just sweat, so Do you think maybe you sweat from your urethra? No, I didn't sweat through my You know what? Let's not talk about it.
Because talking about it will only exacerbate - Stop.
- Yeah.
Hey, um, when did you learn to speak German? What? I don't speak German.
- You sure? - Yeah.
All this hardware for $70,000? - Yup.
- It's nice work.
Oh, look at all this stuff.
Oh, is that a Radeon There's no "we.
" You don't do this kind of work, remember? You make a living with your mind, not your hands.
- No, no, no - So don't touch.
You misunderstood me.
I like hardware.
I made my own computer when I was nine.
From scratch or kit? It was from a kit, but I did my own mods.
- That's what I thought.
- I was nine.
I'm sure you were great at fingerpainting, also, Dinesh.
Richard is the CEO.
He delegated this to me.
Why don't you go inside and write some princess code? Leave the hardware up to us servants.
All right, I got the crimper and some heat shrink.
- Great.
- Wait, she can help but not me? That's right.
Can I help? Please? Mmm, no.
I said Richard, you have to let me help him.
Dinesh, you have to hack away on the front end of the build anyway.
- So why don't you - Excuse me? - Excuse me? - Oh, this is bullshit.
- Oh, hey, Noah.
- I thought you guy were moving up? But it looks like you're moving back in.
Well, yeah, it's a little complicated, but What are you guys doing in there? What, you building some kind of computer? Well, more of a server/data center.
It's actually pretty interesting, if you're into that sort of stuff.
Hello? Stop talking immediately! Come inside.
Don't look at me.
Don't look at me! Don't look at me.
Just tell him that you shit your pants and have weak knees.
What were you doing out there? - Oh, um - Why were you talking to that person? 'Cause he lives next door.
I was just being neighborly.
Neighborly? First of all, that's not a word.
Second of all, you don't talk to the neighbors, ever.
In fact, don't talk to anybody.
It's no one's business what we do here.
Why would anyone care what goes on in here? 'Cause we're not zoned for business, obviously.
What what do you mean we're not zoned for business? I just moved my entire business here! You just keep your mouth shut and everything will be fine.
You talked me into staying here even though you knew we were breaking the law? I'm sorry, Erlich, but I'm pissed.
- You're pissed at me? - Yeah.
I should be pissed at you.
- You know why? - Why? Because when one is given a parting gift and one never parts, shouldn't one return the said gift? Isn't that what decorum would dictate? Oh, this is out the kimono? Okay, I will give it back to you right now, gladly.
Now I'm really pissed.
Because if one appreciated a gift of such magnitude, then one would put up more of a fight before returning it, wouldn't one? Okay, okay.
A complaint from the neighbor to the Department of Planning and Community Environment triggers an inspection, which can lead to a citation, fines, or even the seizure and impounding of our equipment.
That gentleman next door has the power to ruin us.
Jesus.
Richard, can I suggest you take it easy on the Red Bulls? It's a diuretic, and given your issue My issue? Oh, God.
It's night sweats, Jared.
Yes, well, regardless of what we've decided on calling it, pounding caffeine and sugar is not exactly going to help.
But you know what might? Kegels.
What? Kegels are a form of exercise that strengthen the pelvic floor.
Yes, it's most commonly used by women to recover control of their vaginal muscles after childbirth, but it can really help, you know, "night sweats.
" Wow.
Okay, we're not going to talk about this anymore.
I'm doing it right now.
Clench, unclench, clench Stop.
You hear that? Hey, hey.
Stop it, hey.
Turn the music down.
Turn it turn it off.
We have neighbors.
Are you kidding me? Look, Gilfoyle, you said that you would have all the servers up and running.
And we're already a week behind.
Don't you think you should be doing that instead of, you know, getting high on the job? I'm not getting high on the job.
I'm getting high at home.
I live here, remember? Right, okay, fair enough.
Fair enough.
But Carla doesn't.
These guys don't.
I'm having them over as guests, at my home.
If that's okay with you, Richard.
This is your home.
- Yes.
- You live in the workplace.
But you also work from home.
That must be really confusing for you.
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
That's kind of the Does it look dark to you guys? Oh, hey, guys.
Dude, what the fuck? The power's out.
Okay, fine, I wanted to set up one GPU, just one, and so I turned the power on and the whole system lit up.
And Yeah, it did, you dick.
'Cause I bypassed the meter to save money and went directly to the feed without the UPS ready.
That surge just fragged the whole fucking system.
Holy shit.
What the hell did you guys do? The power in the whole block is down.
Great.
What the Oh, God, look who it is.
We need to talk, guys.
Hold on a sec.
No, whatever you're going to say, just say it from there.
We can hear you.
If you didn't have so many cars parked here, maybe I could get through.
He's really going to go all the way around? - That's a long ways.
- Hold on.
Jesus Christ! Save some battery, for Christ's sake! - Just a sec.
- Just yell it! It's okay, Noah, we get it.
You can say it from there.
You're gonna report us to the city inspector, right? Jesus! Guess what? I'm reporting you to the city inspector.
Right.
Zoning codes are very clear.
Neighborhood's for families, pets.
Nicht verstehen! Holy shit.
Come here, Agamemnon.
Come here, boy.
Yes.
Who's a good boy? Yeah, you're a good boy.
Come here, Agamemnon.
Did that blackout scare you, Agamemnon? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy.
Yeah.
Give me a kiss.
Mwah! - Oh, yeah.
- Holy shit.
Oh, yeah.
Daddy loves you, Daddy loves you.
Give me a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Oh, yeah.
Erlich? - What is it? - Hey.
Um, I'm sorry I didn't give you back the kimono or resist giving you back the kimono, or whatever it was, but I have a gift that might make it up to you.
Is that what I think it is? - Mm-hmm.
- Oh, boy.
It is 4:00 in the morning! What the Why are you both wearing kimonos? Noah, are you familiar with the California Fish and Game Code, section 2116-2126, with regard to the possession and harboring of ferrets? - Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah.
Those little shits are illegal.
Erlich, please, don't.
I'll I'll do anything.
Oh, yeah, you will.
We are here to stay, and you're going to keep that bearded little hole in the center of your face shut about it.
- Listen, I was just trying - No, you listen.
You're always going on and on about how this is such a good neighborhood.
Do you know why it's such a good neighborhood? Do you know why your shitty house is worth 20 times what you paid for it in the 1970s? Cause of people like us moving in and starting illegal businesses in our garages.
All the best companies Apple, Google, Hewlett-Packard, even Aviato, all of them were started in unzoned garages.
That is why Silicon Valley is one of the hottest neighborhoods in the world.
Because of people like us, not because of people like you.
So if I catch even so much as a dirty glance or a lascivious look in Richard's direction, that is it.
Those weasels are dog food.
Okay.
Okay.
Um, guest house.
Yes.
Is your guest house currently rented out? No, it's not for rent.
Well, it mother-fucking is now.
Your new tenant is Jared Dunn.
His rent will be exceedingly reasonable.
And his utilities will be included.
He speaks German in the night.
Well, if you'll excuse us, we have an illegal business to run.
Erlich? But when our scientists did the study, they found the rate of birth defects in that territory was actually higher before we opened our battery plant there.
But, very good question.
Thank you for that question.
Okay, before I finish up here, I have an announcement.
Today I have accepted the resignation of Dr.
Davis Bannerchek.
So it pleases me to inform you all that effective immediately, Nelson Bighetti has been promoted to sole head dreamer of Hooli XYZ.
Sorry, what? Stand up, Bag Head.
What a meteoric ascension.
Just a few months ago, you co-founded Pied Piper and now you've been promoted twice.
It speaks to your competence.
Give it up for Bag Head, ladies and gentlemen.
And lastly, I have big news.
In anticipation of our big release of Nucleus at CES in January, we've decided to give the world a sneak preview.
Nucleus, in partnership with Dana White and the Ultimate Fighting Championship will be the exclusive provider of live streaming for next month's Ultimate Fighting Championship event, Molina versus Bulgakov II.
I realize the full platform won't be ready until January, but our Nucleus division assures me they are ready for this challenge.
And I can think of no more exciting a way to give a little taste of Nucleus to the entire world than by putting video latency in a rear-naked choke hold.
Great job, team.
All right, back to work.
Did you, uh, tell Gavin where we are on the video situation? He does know thatonverting the whole platform to middle-out has put us at least six weeks behind schedule, right? Well, I'm not going to be the one who tells him we're that far behind.
If you want to, feel free.
I just heard you tell Heidi we'rsix weeks behind? But remember that drop-frame issue I showed you? We're easily 15 weeks behind.
Well, I'm not going to be the one to tell Heidi about that.
Feel free to tell her yourself.
Did I just hear you say we're only 15 weeks behind? I've been integrating the system natively Dude, I don't even want to know about it.

N/A - Homicide

Pardon me, is that seat taken? Oh, Gavin.
Classic Gavin.
- Let's hope this sucks.
- Oh, good.
Monica made it just in time.
Carla, looks like you won't be the only woman in the house for a change.
Christ.
One thing worse than being the only woman in a company - is being one of only two.
- Why's that? Everybody puts this super-weird pressure on you to be friends.
- It's creepy.
- Hey, did I miss it? - No.
- Good.
Monica, I'd like to introduce you to Carla.
Carla, Monica.
Monica, Carla.
- What's up? - Nice to meet you.
I knew you two would hit it off.
Hey.
Monica? It's starting.
Tonight, for the first time ever, streaming live in 4K resolution over the internet, UFC Fight Night, powered by Nucleus! No networks.
No more middleman.
No bullshit.
We're bringing the fights straight to the fans.
We're cutting the cord forever with UFC Fight Pass, powered by Nucleus.
Tonight, you'll get ultimate fighting at the ultimate resolution.
Nucleus puts 4K UHD video in a lossless compression chokehold and forces the competition to tap out.
Oh! - Who's Douchebag? - He sure likes to break stuff.
We are live in Las Vegas.
The picture looks amazing.
Man, Joe, this is a fight we've been looking forward to for a long, long time.
Are we getting a contact high off Erlich, or is the edge starting to warble? No, I see it.
Are they converting down to 24 frames? The defense so far.
Wow! The jerkiness is not a Nucleus issue, right? I mean, it's not going out to the world like that, is it? I think it looks great.
You see that frame judder as the camera pans? The picture's so blocky.
It looks like Minecraft.
It doesn't make sense, it's supposed to be totally lossless.
Let me dump their bit stream to disk and take a look.
She's really smart.
But not afraid to be bawdy.
- Oh, my God.
- They are so fucked.
Yeah, this is bad.
Attack with the left! He's hurt! He's down! He's hit! Oh! It's frozen.
It's frozen.
It is all over! Unbelievable! I have never, in all my years of watching fighting, seen a finishing combination more ferocious! What a spectacular finish by Molina! We're being told that the Nucleus live stream-- - Fuck! - may have cut out during that exchange.
If that is true, what a travesty.
Fuck! Gavin Belson just shit everyone's pants.
He sure did.
The encoding is totally underpowered to cover up their defects.
Nucleus just can't keep up with 4K live stream yet.
Hey.
Could Pied Piper handle live 4K video? I could deploy a live video stream that would be way better than theirs right now.
Jump on it.
Now.
Like, do our own live stream.
Partner with someone like Gavin did.
Look at you two.
Hold on.
Live streaming's not really our primary business here.
Yeah, but beating Nucleus is.
The blogs would go nuts.
We're built for it on my end.
If it's just me hosting seeds and manifests, - I'm good on my end.
- I'm prepared to brag about it and release publicity.
Well, peer-to-peer delivery is good to go here.
Let me know.
Oh, Carla, do you want to show Monica your work station? No, thanks.
Okay, but Hooli had a deal with UFC that would stream a fight.
What do we even do? Don't really have a lot of time here.
That's real.
We could find an event that's already in motion.
Can I make a suggestion? There is a nesting pair of California condors on the closed-circuit feed at the Natural History Museum.
There's an egg in the nest right now.
It's very compelling.
Why don't we just live stream me killing you? I wouldn't be so dismissive.
There was a live stream of an eagle's nest last year that went viral, and was getting millions of hits.
And I don't wanna be inflammatory, but next to a condor, an eagle looks like a common cackling.
Fuck that, Jared.
I've got it.
I'm very good friends with Aaron Anderson.
Double-A? The guy who owns Homicide Energy Drink? Uh, is Homicide the extra douchey energy drink? It sure is.
There's a bunch of stunts and crazy shit on here.
The video player quality is terrible.
It's a perfect candidate.
And Double-A loves me.
He'd definitely hook us up.
How do you know him? From college.
He was a sophomore when I was a senior.
He and his roommates used to live down the hall.
I used to party in their room all the time.
Uh, kind of a mentor-mentee sort of thing.
Coming from a manatee sort of thing.
You look like a ferret that gave up on himself six months ago, Gilfoyle.
- I'm going to ping Double-A.
- Wait What if he says yes? You know? Are we really gonna drop everything to do this? What if we don't get it right? I mean, it could hurt us just like it hurt them.
Shit.
I don't know.
This is critical, Richard.
Maybe we should SWOT this decision.
I don't know what that is, but no.
- SWOT analysis.
- No.
S-W-O-T? No? Holy cow.
Did he really just say "holy cow"? I've had a board ready for just such an occasion.
I've booby-trapped the house with corporate resources.
SWOT is a way of evaluating a decision.
And you just break it down into "strengths," "weaknesses," "opportunities," and "threats.
" - You're fucking joking.
- Not at all.
You can SWOT a concept, a department, or a new initiative.
You can even SWOT a person, although you have to be careful.
They might SWOT you back.
- I wanna SWOT you.
- Well, you can.
Because now you have the tools.
Okay.
Um, shout them out and I'll tack them up.
Jared, I'm really sorry, but I I have to go.
You know, would it make more sense if I worked something up and then I got back to you guys? And okay, great.
I'm on it.
"People love condors.
" "Strengths.
" On top of the roof, Blaine is gonna launch off this ramp.
It's pretty gnarly.
Everything goes right, he'll fly over this street and land on this 15-story building here.
We've got 27 cameras, a couple in the car.
Feed a live edit back here to the data center.
We put everything through your incredible compression, Richard, and up onto the web.
So, what do you think, Richard? I think this is awesome, Double-A.
I mean, it is incredible.
You really have built a giant monument to awesomeness.
I think my aid in helping you achieve this is what inspired me to start my own incubator.
Uh, so, Richard, you ready for this? Oh, yeah.
I think so.
Yeah, uh Double-A, we are psyched.
And, uh, we can do whatever you need.
- Okay, thanks Kool-Aid.
- Kool-Aid? What's that? Are you Kool-Aid? Yeah, it's just a term of endearment.
You know, nickname, I used to rock it back in the day 'cause I was cool and supportive.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, guys, this is Gina, she's one of our event managers.
Hey, uh, Gina, can you take Dinesh and Gilfoyle to the data center, please? Sure.
You wanna follow me? Only if we get hats, Gina.
You can just take mine.
Did you see that? She gave me her hat.
Pretend you've seen a woman before.
Are those Homicide drinks for free? Yeah.
Knock yourself out.
Homicide! Is there any way that it could be maybe more like just You and me talking, and not Erlich? What do you mean? Aren't you guys friends? I thought you go way back.
We do.
But To be honest, I could never stand the guy.
I mean, just hearing his voice again is giving me PTSD.
Right.
But you just called him cool.
No, I called him Kool-Aid.
We all did.
Right.
Because he's like the Kool-Aid pitcher from the ads.
As in, every fucking time we were hanging out without him, he'd come smashing through a wall.
But you still hung out with him.
Yeah, 'cause we were 19, and he had weed and beer.
But even drunk and high I couldn't take it.
I mean, it's like he's fucking allergic to letting other people talk.
It's like he's always gotta say something.
You know? Hey, Richard.
Homicide! So, Dinesh, I have a question.
You're obviously Pakistani, but the name Dinesh is Indian, isn't it? Yeah.
Wow, that's exactly right.
You know, most people, ignorant people, don't even know those are two separate countries.
And they don't care either.
How do you know about my name? I'm an Army brat.
My dad was stationed in Karachi when I was a kid.
It was a beautiful place.
Full of beautiful people.
Kind of like this room, right? Oh, hold on a sec.
I'll be right back.
- Oh, don't take too long.
- Ew.
This is awesome.
I don't know if it's what's in this, but I have, like, all these killer lines coming to me.
I'm on fucking fire right now.
Oh! She likes me, right? Yeah, she's totally into you.
Just not as into you as she is into that guy's mouth.
He's definitely gonna fuck her later, and she's not gonna think of you while it's happening.
Goddamn it.
Fuck.
Now I'm just shaking.
What do they put in this shit? Milk thistle? Hey, guys! Come out here! Juliet calls.
Guys, this is Blaine.
He's the guy doing the stunt.
Blaine, these are the genius coders who are helping us with the live stream.
- They're rock stars.
- Okay.
So this is the car you're jumping? Yes, it is.
And that's what your ramp's gonna look like? - Yeah.
- Cool.
Well, have you Yeah, and because I know that you're gonna ask, yes, I've done this before.
And yes, it's fucking dangerous.
Listen, I got a lot of work to do to get this right.
Okay? Okay.
Hey, you see what I saw? Yes, uh, he's got the velocity calculated wrong.
It's for a flat plane.
He doesn't account for the curve in the ramp.
Exactly.
He's probably used to doing straight ramps.
I mean, the chart says he's gonna launch at 81 miles per hour, - but it's going to be more like-- - Under 70.
The downforce is ridiculous.
He's gonna lose speed and hit the side of that wall.
And die.
So we should probably Okay.
All right.
Hey, uh, Blaine? - One small thing.
- No.
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glasses.
'Cause I told you once already, and I was very clear.
I am too fucking busy to deal with you.
Okay? I'm just being cool here.
All right? - What do we do here? - This is a tough one.
So, Richard, in terms of a player window, what do you see? Well, um, I think it's pretty straightforward.
I'll handle this, Richard.
- You don't have to.
- The whole reason we're doing this, friend, is for branding value.
So we're gonna need a banner that says "Powered by Pied Piper" underneath the video window.
It doesn't have to be too big, but you don't want it to be too small either.
Although, there's nothing small about Homicide, Double-A.
At least as far as I can tell.
Also, if it's, if it's possible-- Let me stop you right there, Richard.
We're gonna need to have our logos on the car, Blaine's suit, his helmet.
If he wants to get a Flash tattoo or something on his neck, that's on him.
Actually, um, in all honesty, Erlich just pretty much said exactly what I was gonna say.
Uh-huh.
Um, so, Richard - Yes? - Yeah? Do you think you can make the preview window full resolution? - Um, yes - Richard can give you whatever you need.
But as far as the video player goes Guys, I'm sorry.
I just remembered that I've got somewhere else to be.
All right.
Well, Double-A, I'll see you soon.
I'm just gonna grab a shirt and we'll check you later.
What the fuck, dude? Hey, I love your tech.
But come back tomorrow without Kool-Aid, or don't come back at all.
Honestly.
- Richard, what's going on? - What do you mean? I'm catching kind of a vibe.
A weird vibe with you and Double-A.
Right.
That.
Well I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Richard.
I don't think he likes you.
I mean, he literally rolled his eyes at you.
Why don't you just trust me on this one.
Let Kool-Aid do the talking tomorrow.
Take this stuff.
I'm gonna grab a couple more drinks and another hat.
I'm gonna get a box.
This is a total fucking disaster.
If my engineers had just told me they weren't ready, I never would have pushed for this live stream.
Even worse, now I hear those little Pied Piper fuckers are doing their own live stream with Homicide.
- The energy drink? - Yes.
Meanwhile, I've demanded to see internal testing from every facet of the Nucleus platform.
So I can see for myself where I stand.
Because all I hear from everybody is good news.
Have I just surrounded myself with sycophants, who are just telling me whatever I want to hear, regardless of the truth? No.
- Thank you, Denpok.
- I really needed to hear that.
This might be morbid, but the cold hard fact is that if Blaine dies on our live stream, this could be good for us.
I mean, we'd get a lot more traffic.
Well, and it would probably lead to calls for regulations in the stunt industry.
So, in the long term, we're saving lives.
Although, there is the moral problem with letting him die.
Though he did tell us to shut up.
And his name is Blaine.
And Gina is super hot.
And this would make her single.
She'd probably need consoling, so there's an opportunity.
Opportunity.
Should we SWOT this? Bereaved women do tend to act out sexually.
Yeah, so that's a strength.
- Hey, Kool-Aid! - Yeah! And? So? And? It wasn't meant to be a flattering nickname.
It was an insult.
I'm not sure I agree with that.
I mean, the dancing pitcher breaks through walls to give tasty beverages to kids in need.
Why would you infer from this that Double-A doesn't like me? Well, um, I wasn't inferring anything.
He told me to my face that he doesn't like you.
But why wouldn't he like me? Well, uh, you have a tendency sometimes to-- Why on earth wouldn't he like me? Because, Erlich, you tend to not let-- I was his mentor.
You know? You know, there's no remote possibility-- Because you don't let people talk! It just happened.
Um and he told me that if you came tomorrow that he would pull the plug on the whole live stream.
I see.
Sorry.
Are you done talking now? Yes.
Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know about this? Uh, no, I came straight to you.
- What about Jared? - No.
Okay, here's what you need to do.
You need to go in tomorrow, and you need to do that live stream.
Put my feelings aside, you know, don't quit on account of me.
I wasn't gonna I wasn't gonna quit.
There is something you should know, though.
Aaron Anderson wasn't very well liked in college.
In fact, people used to call him "Double-Asshole.
" So watch out for that guy.
Are you sure you're okay with this? Yes, Richard.
It's time for me to be the bigger man.
The cooler man.
I am Kool-Aid, after all.
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last to explore a standard HooliPhone upgraded with a brand-new operating system called Nucleus.
Thank you all for being here, Aln, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie, RamÃ³n.
I'd like to get everyone's first impressions.
Who'd like to jump in? Anyone? How about you, RamÃ³n? It's just stupid.
Okay, so RamÃ³n feels the phone is stupid.
Could you elaborate, RamÃ³n? Stupid how? Please, be as specific as possible, RamÃ³n.
Well, it's slow.
The apps keep quitting on me.
I tried to watch a movie, and it kept freezing up.
And when I'm typing, like, there's a delay.
Then all the letters pop up at once.
You took a good phone and you made it all, like, shitty.
Keep in mind, I didn't design the phone.
It pissed me off.
I appreciate your honesty, RamÃ³n.
That's just one guy's opinion.
Who else feels this product is stupid? Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.
And did it piss off anyone else? - Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.
- Okay.
Christina, how bad is this? Be honest.
Is this Windows Vista bad? It's not iPhone 4 bad, is it? Fuck.
Don't tell me this is Zune bad.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
It's Apple Maps bad.
And who else felt this product is messed up? - Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana - Fuck! I'm sorry for the disturbance, Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana.
So I can definitely get you full res on the preview window.
- Aw, sweet.
- Cool.
I'll get right on that.
You see how much smoother this all runs without Erlich hanging around? Right, yeah.
Hey, did you ever send me the mockup for the logo placement of the player window? Seriously, you should think about dropping that guy.
But what do I know? I just built a billion-dollar company.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.
But, uh, about the mockup for the logo placement Oh, hey.
I gotta go Skype with my European distributor.
Keep cranking it, okay? Sure, uh, will do.
Excuse me.
That's not the final graphic for the live stream, is it? Yep.
Double-A signed off on it.
- Just that? There's nothing else? - Nope.
- Hm Blaine doesn't die, but he is horribly incapacitated.
And then while he's in the hospital, he gets a flesh-eating virus, and then he dies.
Well, obviously his incessant suffering will be a strength.
But our ability to enjoy it is an opportunity.
What if before he dies Gina catches the virus? And then she spreads it from her vagina to your penis.
Wait, so in this scenario, I get to have sex with Gina? That's an opportunity.
- Okay, how about this? - I'm listening.
We let Blaine die, but then he's not around to stop someone else from committinsome huge fucked-up act of evil? - The "Kill Hitler" scenario.
- Right.
Hey, guys? You guys busy? Uh Cool.
Um I got something I gotta say.
Listen.
I know that I was really rude to both of you yesterday.
It's just, um when I got a stunt coming up, I'm a bundle of nerves, and sometimes I can take that out on other people.
Even with all the support that I get from Gina and our kids.
Okay I don't know why.
But and then again, I'm a guy who needs to risk his life jumping over stuff.
So, what's that all about, right? You know, actually just an hour ago I spotted an error in my math.
Would have had me smeared across the side of that building.
Uh Anyway, now I'm just totally rambling.
Typical Blaine.
What I wanted to say was that I'm sorry.
Are we cool? Yeah, we're cool.
Thanks for stopping by.
Yeah, you should go quickly, 'cause we have work to do.
What's this? What is that? "Let Blaine die"? Oh.
Shit.
We write in code we write in code.
- This is compression - "Strengths.
Blaine's last moment is realizing face is gone"? "Weaknesses Blaine dies super fast.
" Yeah, you really shouldn't be looking at that.
That's all proprietary.
fuck Gina"? Would you believe that was here when we came in? Double-A? Can I talk to you for a second? Uh, yeah.
Leave me alone for a sec.
What's up? Well, okay, uh, I just saw a version of the player window that apparently you approved of that says Powered by Homicide on it? Oh.
Yeah, it does.
Right.
Well, there's no Pied Piper logo.
Like anywhere.
So what's up with that? Oh, well Homicide is an energy drink, and "power" means energy.
So that's kind of confusing to the consumer, so I think we're gonna keep it the way it is.
Uh, the whole point of doing this was so that we could get our name out there.
Remember? I tell you what.
Let's see how it goes this time, the next time we'll work something out.
Uh, no.
No.
We can't see how it goes this time.
There is no next time.
Okay? We are racing to get our platform ready for CES.
And we took time away from doing that to do this so we could get PR value.
If no one sees the logo, then there's no PR value at all.
Oh, man.
I'm sorry.
But you get it.
No, I don't get it.
Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.
That's it.
Period.
Mm actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.
Okay, then neither do I.
Richard, don't be an asshole like your buddy Kool-Aid.
Okay? Just finish the build, okay? You know what, Double-A? Erlich was right.
You are an asshole.
In fact, you're a double-asshole! What did you call me? I I called you a double-assle.
'Cause, you know, you're being an asshole.
Double-A, double-asshole.
You know? You're twice the asshole.
Twice-hole.
Double-asshole.
Oh.
Ew.
Is that a colostomy bag? Do you have any idea what it's like to be ten years old and carry your own shit around in a bag? To have two assholes? I didn't know Hey, Richard? We should go.
urinate on Blaine's grave"? "Grief threesome with Gina and Blaine's hot mom, question mark"? - What the fuck?! - I didn't - Richard! - But I mean, you were being an asshole.
Okay, good luck.
To his face? You called him that to his face?! How could you not mention the colostomy bag? Because it's a very private and personal matter! It's not a laughing matter! But you called him double-asshole first.
- Remember? In college? - Yeah, but not to his face.
Never to his face! Not even I'm not that fucking cruel! - But you are! - I'm actually not.
You tore double-asshole a third asshole! Triple-A! Yeah, that was all my fault somehow? Yeah, that was a big wank.
Since we're already set up for a live stream, might I make a suggestion? Wow.
It looks even better than I thought it would.
- Is that a still image? - It's not frozen, is it? No, it's live.
It's just not moving very much because it's a fucking egg.
But think of the wonderful things going on inside that egg.
The resolution in your imagination is infinite.
Oh, hey, we're up to 17 views.
Okay, well, this isn't the PR coup that we'd envisioned.
But, uh, Nucleus fucked up way worse.
At least we can go back to work knowing that we're the only middle-out compression that actually functions.
New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc? Steel-aged.
Drinks great during the day.
I can move, so you guys can stand next to each other.
- Jared! Dude, no.
- God, no! Russ, hey.
Good job, my man! Fucking live stream looks amazing! - It does? - Yeah, Homicide must be stoked! - Homicide? What? - Russ: I love the new name.
It's kick-ass.
I always thought Pied Piper was kind of a limp-dick name.
EndFrame is way cooler.
EndFrame? What? Three, two, one! He made it.
Farewell, sweet Gina.
"Powered by EndFrame.
" Who the fuck is EndFrame? Why is their fucking logo on this live stream? - EndFrame isn't you guys? - Oh, fuck! EndFrame is those guys that brain-raped us at Branston Ventures.
"EndFrame is a compression company specializing in middle-out compression technology.
" Those pricks! They stole my algorithm! I know guys at the FBI we could call.
Were you fucking hacked? - Uh actually, no.
- Well, how did they get it then? - I'm sorry? - How did they get it then, Richard? How did they get it? Well, we kinda found ourselves in their conference room, and accidentally sketched out our key components to our algorithm's data model on their whiteboards.
You fucking Russ? He hung up.
I'd file this one under "Weakness," Jared.

Hey, welcome to EndFrame.
Yes, hi.
Would you Just tell your boss that the CEO of Pied Piper is here to see them? That's the company that they ripped off.
Sure.
And your name is, sir? Erlich Bachman.
No.
I'm Richard Hendricks.
I'm the CEO.
- Oh, really? - Yes.
Why would you assume that he's the CEO? Well, he's No reason.
Um The guys are in a staff meeting right now though.
They should be out shortly.
Would you guys like some water while you wait? We have four flavors, and the cartons are made from locally sourced organic Yeah, we get it.
You're funded, so They're good.
The market has been exceptionally volatile lately.
As a result many of the very aggressive positions we took at your specific request have performed poorly.
Very, very poorly.
Do you understand? Yeah.
Would you fuck her? If I weren't married, I suppose but, Russ, as your business manager, I need to tell you something, and you're not going to like it.
At all.
So, what's the plan here, Richard? We're not gonna, like, fight them, right? Uh No, no.
I don't I just I mean, we got to do something.
Even if it's just yelling at them telling them that they're not gonna get away with this.
But you know they are, right? Well, not if I have anything to do about it.
But you sort of don't.
I support you, Richard, no matter how futile the effort.
Thanks.
Look who just right-swiped me on Tinder.
Karen.
She's cute.
Says here that she's looking for a man on the go.
You don't "go" anywhere.
What, are you getting that res on 4G? - She's cute, right? - Wow.
Yoyodyne Wi-Fi? That's the company next door.
Why is their Wi-Fi password saved on your phone, Dinesh? Huh? Um I have a friend who works there.
Friend? What friend? You don't have any friends.
Maroush Davidson Jones.
Okay, fine.
Fine.
You got me.
A couple of weeks back, I went on a few interviews, okay? And Yoyodyne was one of them.
Jesus.
Back off.
Outed by Wi-Fi.
It was when you said you were selling to Hooli and you know, as soon as you went with Russ, I blew them off.
You know what? Fuck this.
I'm not waiting anymore.
I'm going in there.
Mr.
Bachman's walking back to you now.
That's not my name.
My name is Richard Hendricks.
Hey, remember us? Oh.
Hey, guys.
What's up? You know what you did.
Okay? I saw your live stream.
Okay? I saw your "algorithm.
" That's mine.
You stole it.
Stole? We asked you guys some questions a while back and you were very helpful.
See? Look.
These, the photos.
These are the photos.
This is proof that you stole it from us.
No, those photos prove that you gave it to us.
Well, you're stealing it all wrong.
I mean, this is how you're gonna build the code book? Honestly? This is bush-league.
And look at all these redundancies.
I mean, look, if you're gonna build it like that - Richard, no.
- Richard.
Ugh Hey, pen down, Dumbledorf.
Suffice to say there is something somewhere on this board that is gonna strangle you at scale.
Don't write that down.
Stop.
Here me when I say this.
Your tech is always gonna be worse than ours.
That's fine.
How is that fine? 'Cause we have a finished platform and you don't.
Which means, we're the only middle-out company currently in the marketplace.
And that's enough for my sales team.
Your what? This is our sales team.
Okay.
Hear that sound, buddy? That's the sound of us leaving you in the dust.
Gentlemen of the Hooli board and lady, question, what is failure? To the ignorant or those in conventional industries, the recent Nucleus glitch may seem a failure purely in the negative sense.
But we, in this valley, all know that "failures" just like this one are really stepping stones.
To bring us the iPhone, Steve Jobs first had to bring us the Newton.
To bring us Facebook Mark Zuckerberg also had to bring us Wirehog.
Before he brought us Digg, Kevin Rose had to bring us a whole lot of useless things and after Digg as well, for that matter.
The point being what those in dying business sectors call failure, we, in tech, know to be pre-greatness.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Are you telling us that the disastrous results of your Nucleus live stream are a good thing? No, I'm not telling you that.
History is telling you that.
Please, Gavin, enough spin.
A misstep of that magnitude, there's no excuse.
It's not like we can tell the shareholders you've suddenly added new functionality.
Haven't I? Have you? We weren't told about this.
If I told you about it, it wouldn't exactly be a secret function.
Now, would it? Secret function? Are you saying you've added something new to the Nucleus platform? Imagine if you will a function so game-changing, that its integration into Nucleus will justify any miscue in the platform's roll out.
Imagine, if you will, a function so game-changing, that its integration into Nucleus will justify any miscue in the platform's roll out.
Seriously, imagine it, and do it quickly.
You were all brought here to generate moonshots.
I need a moonshot now.
If there's any greatness in any of you at all, now is the time to access it.
Please don't disappoint me.
Please, please, please don't disappoint me.
Maybe start after lunch? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
Hello? Russ? Oh, my God.
Is that shit? - Oh - Is there dog shit on the floor? Yes, it's shit.
God! What happened to your painting? That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I've got some bad news, and you're gonna hear it eventually, so you might as well hear it from me.
Sit down.
My accountant has informed me that, uh I'm financially ruined.
Holy shit.
How? Because of a series of bad investments that my fucking money guy let me talk him into, I've managed to lose over $200 million.
Wait.
Didn't you start out with $1.
2 billion? I mean, you're not exactly broke, right? I might as well be.
$986 million? I'm not a billionaire anymore, Richard.
I'm a nine-hundred- and-eighty-sixionaire, which isn't even a fucking thing.
I'm out of the Three Comma Club.
Functionally, I'm just like you.
Jesus, fuck, that's depressing.
Right.
But you're still, basically, a billionaire.
Not if you round down.
If you round down, I have zero billion.
"Forbes" has taken me off their billionaire's list.
Instead, they'll probably put me on their close-but-no-cigar list, which is ironic because I smoke a fuck ton of cigars.
Why the fuck do I buy so many cigars? I remember the second I became a billionaire.
I was ass-naked sitting right there, just clicking and refreshing, clicking and refreshing, watching my stock rise.
And when it happened, I popped a rod so fast, I went blind for a full minute.
Nutted all over those cushions.
I was the king.
Now look at me.
Two shitty fucking commas.
I had to sell my McLaren.
Yeah, but there's a Maserati in the driveway.
Who gives a fuck? That has doors that open like this.
Not like this.
Or like this.
So it's all fucked.
Well, it's not all fucked.
You did save $50,000 not paying for the charity ball tickets that you gave me.
Quite an embarrassing moment for Jian-Yang and I.
What? Richard, listen, my accountants tell me I need you to start throwing off cash as quickly as possible, okay? But you said generating revenue was exactly what we shouldn't be doing.
But now that I'm spelling billion with an "M," I'm saying do the exact opposite.
I need you to come back to me in 24 hours and bring me a proposal that turns the entire operation into a sales-based model, just like you told me those assholes over at EndFrame have.
You're gonna dig me out of this hole, Richard.
- What? - You said it yourself.
EndFrame is built to grab a bunch of cash quickly, - and that's what I need.
- Uh Dad, where is Mom? Your mom is with her friend Philippe.
They're in Napa.
She's gonna be a few hours.
These guys are gonna watch you, okay? Watch out for the dog shit.
Okay? I gotta hit the road.
Daddy's going to Vegas.
Flying in a rented Citation Ultra.
Fuck me! Hello.
Uh hey, buddy.
Russ wants us to convert to a sales model? That's just not possible.
I mean, you saw the size of that team at EndFrame.
There were 40 people in that room? Right.
Even if we fired all of the engineers that we just hired Looking good.
Keep at it, Claude.
Absolutely.
Your jobs are not at risk.
That's very comforting.
Even if we adjusted our workforce and hired sales people instead, Service Level Agreements like that are enormously complex, they take a huge number of man hours.
There's no way we could find clients, negotiate terms, and push deals out the funnel fast enough to yield real cash anytime soon.
We're just not built for it.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, Karen posted another photo.
Sending it to you right now.
Wait.
Why does it say "sent from my iPhone" at the bottom? You just sent this from your computer.
It's so that I seem like I'm an out-and-about kind of person.
I put that in the signature and then in the body, I'll write fun stuff, like, "I'm at the opening of a secret restaurant.
" Or, "I'm watching 'Jaws' at the pool of an old hotel.
" You know, keep it fun, vague, mysterious.
It is a mystery why you think you'll ever see a woman naked.
Dinesh, do you want a piece of advice? - No, thank you.
- Okay, I I know Karen is out of my league.
Okay? She's practically not my species.
I'm a guppy, and I'm trying to mate with a dolphin.
You guys are bottom-feeders.
You're like the fish that swim into other fish's mouths and eat bacteria off their teeth.
There's no such fish.
You made that fish up.
Okay, it's an analogy.
I'm not gonna debate the existence of the literal fish with you, - 'cause it's not relevant.
- Well good, 'cause it doesn't exist.
That is a real fish.
Why don't you just send emails, from your actual iPhone? It's all the way in my room.
Wait, so you are trying to convince this girl that you run half-marathons, but you won't walk halfway across this house to get your iPhone? Basically.
Hi.
Is there a a Russ Boy genius, what's up? Hey, Russ, uh Look, I've run the numbers 50 different ways, and I just don't know how I'm gonna convert You don't need to know.
I don't pay you to know.
Know what? That's right.
I know, you don't know.
- I don't know what you know.
- No, you don't know, 'cause I figured it out.
You know what? It's what I do.
I put radio on the Internet.
I'm putting the third comma back into my net worth, and you don't have to do jack shit.
Thanks.
Come on, let's get some food.
I'm starving.
Do you want your Richard, hey.
Good to see you again.
What is this? This is the solution.
They're not a competitor if you're a part of them, right? Pied Piper is gonna merge with EndFrame.
I mean, seriously, I'm a genius, right? Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where the fuck are you going? You're gonna blow this deal.
You cannot be serious.
Those are the guys who ripped off my algorithm, which they totally fucked up, by the way.
Okay, so now you can fix it.
Y-You give them a better algorithm, they'll give you a killer sales team.
And in exchange for bringing you to them, they give me a big fat buyout of my stake in your company.
I'm that much closer to re-billionizing.
Those guys are clowns.
Clowns with commitments worth millions.
Did you know they have a deal on the table with Intersite? Intersite? The porn company? Really? I know.
Awesome, right? And they've done months of hard work.
All you have to do is show up and compress shit.
The answer is no.
Wrong.
You do this deal, or I pull your funding.
Well, you can't pull funding because we have a contract, so Oh, we have a contract? We have a fucking contract, Richard? You wanna know what I have? A fucking car whose doors open like this.
Not like this, not like this.
These are not the doors of a billionaire, Richard.
Fuck you! Fuck you in the ass.
So you wanna sue Russ Hanneman? Yeah.
Yeah, we had a contract.
He promised to give us $5 million and now he's welshing.
And you wanna sue EndFrame? Yes, because they stole our IP.
Before or after you gave it to 'em? Okay, we were tricked, so Richie, you're not a guy that should be worried about suing people.
You need to be worried about the guy at Hooli who's suing you.
If you don't mount a vigorous legal defense, then you lose to Gavin Belson by default.
And you are stamped "Property of Hooli.
" You let Hanneman walk, how you plan on paying these cats? I just paid them 80 grand.
As a retainer.
That retains them.
Now you gotta pay them.
Hold on.
So I just paid them $80,000 for the right to pay them more? Yeah.
Fucking lawyers, man.
Right? Like it or not, Richie, you're stuck with Hanneman.
I mean, technically, it's not even a merger.
EndFrame just absorbs you, and you're gone.
Right.
So, basically, we end up working for EndFrame after giving them our idea, which was way better than theirs, and they end up making more money than us.
Fuck that.
Assholes.
Fucking king-sized assholes.
Butt-holes indeed.
What if we didn't do that? What if, instead, we got our own client like EndFrame has, a porn company or something? That's not really how it works, Gilfoyle.
You can't just go get a client.
- Why not? - 'Cause it's not that easy.
Why not? 'Cause EndFrame worked that Intersite deal for months, kicking every detail of the contract and SLA back and forth, promising tons of custom features.
And you can't just make that stuff up.
What if I didn't have to make it up? What if I had every detail of their deal on my computer right in front of me? I'm sorry, um Are you just asking what if or do you actually have this information? Gilfoyle, please don't tell me that you hacked into EndFrame's system.
Okay.
I won't tell you that.
W-Well, did you hack into it or not? My feeling is if you're the CEO of a company and you're dumb enough to leave your login info on a Post-it note on your desk, while the people that you fucking ripped off are physically in your office, it's not a hack.
It's barely social engineering.
It's more like natural selection.
Fucking ninja.
Okay.
I was not in the room while this was happening.
This is way over the line.
This is crazy illegal.
We're not trading on stolen information.
It's not worth it.
What if it was worth it? It's not, so Gilfoyle, uh, hypothetically, how much is it worth? $15 million.
- What? - Holy shit! Okay, I was definitely not in the room while this happened.
I've got it all right here with a bow on it Delivery dates, benchmarks.
They're promising to deliver high-quality 4K streaming video at 20 megabits per second.
That's it? That's dog shit.
If we can put a half-decent build of our platform in front of Intersite, I mean, we can shark this 15 mil right out from under EndFrame.
I I don't understand.
How does Intersite have all this money to throw around? It's pornography, Richard.
Adult content has driven more important tech adaption than anything.
The first fiction ever published on a printing press was an erotic tale.
And from there, it was Super 8 film Polaroid, home video, digital, video on demand Credit card verification systems, Snapchat.
Pornography accounts for Reducing Intersite server load by a tiny fraction, could save them tens of millions of dollars a year.
Hundreds.
$15 million is only like six hours of Intersite CDN bill, right? But to us, that I mean, we could settle out with Russ, pay our legal fees, have plenty of runway to get us to CES.
Minor detail.
This is stealing.
You mean like lying and telling someone that you want to fund their company, and then taking their tech when they meet with you? Like that kind of stealing? You wanted to do something, Richard.
This is something.
It's time to walk the left-hand path, Richard.
The statistics here are clear.
Protecting existing revenue streams in the current climate is no longer a viable option.
We must run forward simply to stay in place, by doing what the adult industry has always done, lead.
Pioneering cutting-edge interfaces across new device platforms like Oculus and iWhack will be the key to our survival as an industry.
And based on their recent investment patterns, tech leaders such as Facebook agree.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the future.
What is that on your computer screen? A fractal? No, it's just pictures of art I've been sending Karen from my mobile phone which is charging over there.
I told her I just got back from a gallery opening in Hunter's Point.
Who painted that disappointment? Jaden, age five.
I got it from his Montessori school website.
He's not online, he's never gonna find out.
What? Crimes against children Really, so easy to get away with.
Oh, another text from Karen.
"In your 'hood.
Can I come over? "IDK.
Too soon, question mark.
" Fuck.
What's the issue? This is what you want.
You know, it's The place is so dirty right now.
Probably another day is best for such activity? Um, should I tell her I'm out getting Ethiopian tapas? I don't see what the problem is here.
She wants to come over, and she acknowledged that it's too soon.
You've basically done the deed which for you is ejaculating in your own pants all over your leg and then apologizing profusely.
Just maintain eye contact, light some scented candles and throw in some Sade.
The early stuff, though, before her arrangements got too baroque.
Okay, that is sad.
I can do this.
Um She would never sleep with a guy who lives like this.
I don't even know where to start.
Um, do you guys want to help me clean up a little bit real quick? No, don't do that.
- Uh, Miss Kendall.
- Yeah.
Excuse me.
I am data compression.
I do data compression, and, uh, I know that, um, EndFrame is telling you that they can lower your bandwidth and storage costs by delivering your new 4K video stream at 20 megabits per second.
Who the hell are you? Uh, sorry.
I'm Pied Piper.
I am Richard Hendricks of - You're the CEO.
- Yes.
- Uh, thank you.
- I saw you at TechCrunch.
How do you know the specs of my EndFrame deal? I can't I don't Okay.
I don't like this at all, Richard Hendricks.
I'm sorry.
Goodbye.
I can save you millions in bandwidth.
My, uh, algorithm is lossless.
I can deliver the same 4K video, at seven megabits per second, 60 fps.
We are faster and have a higher quality than EndFrame at a third of the bit rate.
- Bullshit.
- I can prove it.
Before you spend a dime, let me prove it.
You know I'm on the board of two charities and a no-kill animal shelter with Gavin Belson, right? The man who is suing you for stealing his IP.
That lawsuit's bullshit.
I have a very complicated deal in place with EndFrame.
Why should I back out and take a risk on you? Back there, you said that your business needs to do whatever it takes in order to survive.
Well, so does mine.
And this is it.
If I don't get this deal, my company is dead.
So this is your place? Yes.
I know it's weird that a guy like me would live here, but, honestly, this is just where I rest.
Out there is where I live.
Did you get my link to the Catalan animation festival? Oh, did I? Where do you stand on the subtitling v.
dubbing debate? 'Cause to me, dubbing is boorish.
'Cause every language to me has its own Hey, how'd you get on our Wi-Fi? How does your phone know the password? Did it? Yeah, it connected immediately.
It's an alpha-numeric - Oh.
- Long password.
- Oh.
Um I Okay, this is really weird.
Karen? Erlich.
Hey.
I didn't realize that it was you, Karen, the Karen that Dinesh You two know each other? In a sense.
Yeah.
What - Outed by Wi-Fi.
Is the specifics of the "sense"? Oh uh You never, uh you never called.
I, uh got super busy.
Hey, we all do.
Well, we should probably head to the festival, so So did you ever find my earrings? I I don't know.
Should we, uh, check the old lost and found? Okay.
So, here goes.
By wearing this standard Hooli ear-bud headphone, modified with a small piezoelectric sensor, the user can control their Hooli phone solely with their neural impulses.
Point, click, drag, even type all using only brainwaves.
Think it and it happens.
Holy shit! Seriously? Seriously.
This is great.
Fuck, yes, team! So, uh, what's our, um, timeline here? I mean, when do we start testing this? How long before we can integrate this into Nucleus? Not long.
It'll probably happen in our lifetime.
We just have to figure out how to make it work.
But I really believe that our grandchildren are going to grow up taking this technology for granted.
Our grandchildren? I know you're single, but you might meet someone.
No.
No! No! What do you have that's ready now? Well Hmm Truth be told, we kind of put all our eggs into this basket, but we do have the kick-ass potato cannon, though.
Although, actually, this one is broken.
We tried to put a Mr.
Potato Head in it, and it did not like that.
Still in there, eh? What do you think? Will they ever find those earrings? Funny thing about lost items always in the last place you look.
Thanks for coming in, guys.
I look forward to working with you.
Us too.
Come on back.
This way.
We're right in here.
Oh, hey, Mark.
Good to see you again.
What is this? This is a bake off.
I'm gonna give EndFrame and Pied Piper the same video library to compress.
In a week, I'll review and award the contract to whoever does a better job.
What? - "Who whomever.
" - What? "Whomever does the better" But okay, yeah.
Never mind.
Welcome to the left-hand path, my friend.





******************************************
N/A - White Hat/Black Hat

- That was awesome.
- We just fed our hogs to those EndFrame motherfuckers.
I don't know.
Oh, shit.
Richard.
I just got a call from Marc at EndFrame.
Yeah.
Uh Sorry that that deal didn't go through, Russ, but this bake-off can be huge for us.
And we should actually get started.
- We have a lot of work to do.
- Yeah.
We have a lot of work to do, Richard.
A lot.
We have to drink this entire bottle of tequila today.
- What? - Bake-off, bitch.
Let's get fucked up.
Shots, baby.
- Uh I don't I don't - Richard, this is my own brand.
Tres Comas.
Do you know what that means in Spanish? - Three comm - Nope.
Three commas.
As in, the number I'll have when we are done kicking the tar out of EndFrame and I make that fuck pile of Intersite money.
Am I right? Come on, shots.
So you're not mad? No, of course not.
Okay.
Yeah, sure.
I'll just do one shot.
We are going to drink to re-billionizing.
Okay.
To re-billionizing.
- To re-billionizing.
- That's it.
One more? Uh Russ we need to pay our lawyers and we need to pay our engineers.
So, before you go, can you just write us another check please? What? No, Richard, giving you money right now is the worst thing I could do for you.
What? Why? How? Look what just happened.
I threatened to walk and you turned lean and hungry, and you clawed your way into a $15-million deal.
And when you win this bake-off, because I gave you no money, and I get my third comma back I promise you this, Richard.
I'm gonna come back here and you and I are gonna polish off this entire motherfucking bottle of Tres Comas together.
Put it right up high.
Come on! Don't leave me hanging.
That's it! That's how we do business.
The Nucleus ad buy will be the largest in our history.
Awareness of this product will be unprecedented.
Yeah.
Am I the only one concerned about over-exposure? Well, we haven't seen the platform yet, but we're planning on slipping Nucleus to influential tech journalists and bloggers.
Because, certainly, once they see Nucleus Sorry, sorry.
That strategy just sounds so inside the box.
Might it not be more innovative to shroud Nucleus in mystery until the official roll out next January? Gavin, I'm sorry.
Is everything okay with Nucleus? We are on schedule, yes? Because based on your assurances, we've staked substantial resources on its performance.
Gentlemen of the board, and Rachel, listen to me very carefully.
Nucleus is on track.
And you have my word that if it fails to be everything we need it to be, someone will be held responsible.
Me? You want me to come back to Hooli? No way.
It's too late.
I've accepted MIT's offer of tenure.
My wife, my children, and my mother are already back in Boston.
I'm here because I believe in you.
And because I believe we didn't believe in you enough before.
Yeah, you did not.
XYZ was beneath your talent.
Surely you felt it.
I did.
Why else would I lay it off on Bighetti? XYZ is about the distant future.
But we can't wait for you.
We need you now, guiding critical components of our core business.
Components like Nucleus.
I'm sorry are you offering to put me in full charge os Nucleus? Indeed I am.
You and only you.
You'll get the credit and the glory.
The name Davis Bannerchek will be inextricably linked with that of Nucleus.
I mean, there's a chance no one will know I had anything to do with it at all.
Gentlemen, nothing else in the truck.
Stop.
Who is done with transcode work flow? Me.
Good job, Carla.
Or should I say, "scrumptious"? Because of the board, the scrum board.
- Oh, I get it.
- Yeah.
Or just I mean, not you.
I mean, you could You are.
Uh Also, thanks to everybody for forgoing your salary this week.
Remember, if we win bonuses all around, so Go team.
When we win.
That is rousing, Richard.
Yeah, so, when we win it.
Whoa! Have you guys seen this? Seth, the network security guy from EndFrame, just changed his Linkedln status to "unemployed.
" No way.
You think we got him fired? I bet we did.
That's awesome.
Well, we never actually breached his security.
Remember we got Marc's login info and went through the front door? So, he didn't actually do anything wrong.
He worked for EndFrame, the pieces of shit that stole our algorithm.
Yeah.
So by the transitive property, he is, therefore, also a piece of shit.
Well, the pieces of shit fired him.
So his "piece of shit" status is reversed.
Okay, fine.
So the transitive property may no longer apply, but the reflexive property states everything's equal to itself.
So, since he's a piece of shit, he's a piece of shit.
Okay, math aside, the point I'm trying to make here is we didn't actually break his code.
Okay? So he's getting fired for no reason.
And I kinda feel bad for the guy.
He's probably pulling his hair out somewhere, wondering where he screwed up.
But he didn't screw up, and he'll never know that for the rest of his life.
I bet you're right.
He probably is just ripping his hair out somewhere.
I wish I could see that.
Piece of shit.
He's a piece of shit.
Monica? Did you forget Jing-Yang eyes pitch? No, I was on my phone.
You talking to Benson or Hedges? Am I right? Cigarette company.
Clever.
What if I told you there is an app on the market Not now.
No, you wait until you're inside.
Okay? We haven't even gotten the bottle of water yet.
Head in.
I'll meet you in there.
I just need to finish this call.
Sure.
Cool with a "K.
" Okay.
Water.
What if I told you there is an app Jian-Yang, this is the assistant.
We wait for the boss to pitch.
The woman you saw outside.
Okay? The lady who was smoking? You said no.
Sorry, sorry Monica was smoking? - Cigarettes? - Cigarettes.
No, no, no.
He's confused.
He's Chinese.
He's talking about this crack-addict prostitute we saw at the gas station.
She was smoking cigarettes.
So sad.
Oh.
Jian-Yang, what're you doing? This is Palo Alto.
People are lunatics about smoking here.
We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.
All right? Where people smoke all the time.
I don't smoke.
Expt for special occasions.
So you do smoke? Wait, have you been smoking in my house? No.
There's no special occasion ever happen in your house.
See this little bald spot on my temple? I've literally been tearing my own hair out.
I e-mailed Gilfoyle about a dozen times, and all he kept sending me were these photos.
Some woman choking.
Balls.
Choking A pair of balls.
I I get it.
"Choke on my balls.
" It's like a rebus.
He's such a dick.
How the fuck did he get into my system? At least give me a hint.
Something.
Anything.
Fuck.
What if, hypothetically uh there was a certain CEO in your office, that left his login information on a Post-it, and a certain someone took it, and used that to get in? Are you saying Gilfoyle never penetrated my network? I'm saying you weren't fired because of anything to do with your security config.
It wasn't my fault? Oh, my God.
You know what? I'm glad I came here.
I think it's good just to get everything out in the open.
That piece of shit! Gilfoyle kept taunting me and taunting me.
- What're you doing? No - Hello, Gilfoyle? Don't call him.
- It's Seth.
- Don't mention me or Richard just told me about the Post-it.
So, fuck you! You just fucked with the wrong hacker.
There's there's kids.
I'm gonna skullfuck your whole system.
Fuck you, Gilfoyle! Fuck you, Richard! Fuck all of you Pied Piper fucks! I actually, don't I don't know him.
I'm just here by myself.
Just watching and waiting.
I love kids.
Not like that.
So Why would do that? Why would you go talk to him? I don't know, you know.
Face-to-face meetings make things better.
I just felt bad for the guy, and he was not doing well.
I mean, what if I hadn't said anything and he'd have, you know killed himself? Yeah, well, there's no chance of that now, is there? Richard, you don't seem to understand what's going on.
We hacked into EndFrame's system and stole their specs.
You can't go traipsinground to their former employees, telling them how we did it just to make them feel better.
You're a fucking black hat now.
Act like it.
What? I'm a black hat? How am I a black hat? EndFrame stole from us first.
And since the negative of a negative is a positive, stealing from a thief is okay.
It's the additive inverse property.
Math aside, Richard, we're all black hats now.
The point is, what are we gonna do about Seth? How do you mean? Well, I mean, we have an unemployed and very pissed off systems guy, who very publicly threatened to skullfuck our whole system.
He's not gonna do shit.
He's a coder.
By definition, we're all pussies.
Look, he'll vent for half an hour and then he'll go LARPing and mogging and stroke his dick for a while.
Even if he does try to crack us, Richard, I built our network security myself.
I'm not worried about it at all.
So, just This doesn't concern you guys? Okay, because he said, and I quote that he was going to skullfuck us! Oh, hey.
Hi.
- You have a great daughter.
- Come on, Ashley, let's go.
Go for Erlich.
Thanks for outing me.
You're gay.
That explains so much.
No, outing me for smoking.
I was heading home when my insane boss called me into the conference room for some kind of anti-smoking intervention.
"No one ever died from secondhand heroin.
" Yeah, she said that.
- What did you say? - I said nothing.
Jian-Yang may have let a little something slip to your boy Friday, but don't worry, I covered with aplomb.
That little weasel tells Laurie everything.
On that topic, what did you think of his app? The fundamental idea is sound.
An app that helps parents find the least crowded playgrounds.
Good.
So you understood him.
The problem is, he's basically created the perfect tool for pedophiles to find victims.
Yes, and pedophiles are typically not early-adopters, so we would miss out on that whole market.
That's problematic.
Well, we'll tweak it when we present it to your boss.
I don't think what I saw was close to ready for Laurie.
Oh, really, Monica? I'm sorry that your boss unearthed your filthy little secret, but believe it or not I actually tried to have your back, and I was hoping you might do the same for me.
Then again, your judgment is suspect.
You are a smoker.
I smoke a few cigarettes a week.
Fine.
I'll ask Laurie for five minutes, but that's it.
And te Jian-Yang he better bring it.
Monica, we may never know what indecipherable Chinese province Jian-Yang comes from, but I know this much, Jian-Yang was born to bring it, and you have got to try women.
I mean, just give it a chan I'm sure the work that you have done so far has been very good.
But now that I am here, the real work begins, and time is of the essence.
I'm gonna need status reports from every department.
Where are we? We have a mobile beta on a HooliPhone.
You wanna see it? Mmm? Yeah.
He quit? What do you mean he quit? According to security, he entered the building at 9:13.
He met with the Nucleus team for 11 minutes.
Then he used his key card to exit the building.
Three minutes later, he was clocked at 73 in a 25 zone going past our daycare center.
He never returned, and he hasn't responded to our calls or e-mail.
Gavin, is it possible that this is a good thing? Bannerchek was gonna step in at the last minute and take a lot of the credit for Nucleus.
Now the world will know that you're responsible for Nucleus.
You and you alone.
Not now! Okay, so no attempts to externally access the system? Right? No SQLi, XSS, worms, Trojans, nothing? Same answer as I gave you the last three days.
No.
Seth hasn't done shit.
We're all good.
Richard, your paranoia has become officially tedious.
Okay, okay.
Our platform is basically built.
Tomorrow, Intersite is gonna start dumping directly onto our server via fucking FTP.
We are gonna be the most vulnerable we've ever been.
And Seth is out there lurking.
Just lurking in the darknet ready to pounce like an Internet panther.
And we don't care.
Okay, well, frankly, your lack of paranoia is insane to me.
Now you're paranoid that we're not paranoid enough? You're para-paranoid, Richard.
Where are you going? To the kitchen.
Why are you going together? Are you gonna talk about me? What're you looking at? You guys have got a lot of work to do.
I'm glad you reached out.
And I want you to know I'm not gonna do any of those things that I threatened to do.
Really? Just to be clear, no skullfucking of any kind? No.
I guess I just needed to vent.
Actually, I was pretty worried that your were gonna do something crazy.
You can relax.
And please tell Gilfoyle I'm sorry for what I said, and that he can relax, too.
Oh, you don't have to worry about Gilfoyle.
He couldn't have cared less.
Really? Yeah.
You know, I gotta I gotta be honest.
I mean, I'm really glad I came back here.
I mean, Dinesh and Gilfoyle obviously said it was a bad idea, especially given what happened.
But this just really restores my faith that face-to-face meetings are the way to That smug cocksucker didn't think I had the skills to break into his system, that motherfucker.
What? What are you Don't Who are you calling? Hello, Gilfoyle.
It's Seth again.
Hey, don't mention that I Richard here just told me you're not afraid of me.
Well, you know what I'm gonna do to you now, motherfucker? Get out our here.
Scatter.
Scatter.
I'm skullfucking the shit out of your system this time.
How you like me now, you cocksucking, motherfucking piece of shit? In our initial build we realized that the same geo-tagging technology that could be used to locate uncrowded playgrounds could also be used to prey on children, our greatest natural resource, by one of society's worst elements Pedophiles.
The pedophile facing nature of the app would present marketing pain points.
Yes.
But under Monica's guidance, we realized the same technology could also be used to create a real-time, crowd-sourced map of an even worse segment of the population.
Worse than pedophiles? Smokers.
Because, let's face it, no one's ever died of secondhand heroin.
True.
True.
With our app, users can locate and thus avoid these self-indulgent, self-destructive, negligent monsters.
Negligent? Yeah.
We call it "Smokation.
" It's a clever hybrid of "smoker" and "location.
" It's interesting.
It's interesting.
Well done.
Well done.
So what kind of term sheet do you think she's gonna lay on us? There's a lot of work to do, but you certainly knew how to play to your audience.
So I'd say it looks good.
Oh, today is a great day.
What is he doing? Special occasion.
Oh, shit.
You brought cigarettes in here? No, I take from her purse.
Well, this is it.
Our pants are basically around our ankles until this transfer is done.
Anything? Again, no.
Nothing.
Well, did you sweep for Unauthorized kernel modules, yes.
I even purged the entire server hypervisor again.
I know we are vulnerable, right now, but, Richard, we're covered, okay? We severed the prod and dev net.
Look, you made us put our phones in a fucking Faraday cage.
We even killed the Wi-Fi and reverted back to this stone age hard line Ethernet switch.
Look at all this shit.
Are we in the '90s? Richard, no one is cracking our transfer.
Not Seth, not some rogue nuclear state, not Sk3wl of fucking R00t.
No one.
And in two hours and 47 minutes when we've pulled all of Intersite's data onto our servers, we're golden.
So just chill the fuck out.
Do another Weissman test to make yourself feel better.
I just did.
Still at 5.
1? Actually, 5.
2.
Holy shit, dude.
That's blazing.
Wait, so we're actually gonna win this thing.
I don't know.
Ask me again in two hours and 46 minutes.
Hey, quit all the fucking and let me in.
- Hey, come on, why's the door locked? - Coming.
- Are you afraid you're gonna get raped? - Jared, don't What? You're locking the door now? You don't answer my texts.
What the fuck? Russ, we're at a pretty critical juncture right now, so What's that? That is pornography, thousands of hours of it.
Yeah, it is.
Russ, tomorrow, I would be happy to walk this through with you.
Okay.
I'm out of here.
Just answer me this, are we good? Yes.
The platform is running great.
But it's just really fragile right now and we have a lot to focus on.
So, again, probably tomorrow would be Fine, fine.
After we have tequila.
Uh - What? - Shots, boys.
- I'm in.
- No, no one's in.
What are We're not doing shots right now, Russ.
Richard, come on, quit being such a pussy, and have some tequila with your money guy.
You're not our money guy.
- I'm not your money guy.
- Since when? Since you stopped giving us money, asshole.
Who's an asshole? I forced you to get lean.
No.
You forced us to hack EndFrame and break the law.
And now, like it or not, I'm a fucking black hat.
But that's okay.
That's okay.
That's cool.
We're gonna win this bake-off and pay you enough money to go away forever.
So take your shitty tequila and your shitty jeans with fucking metal chunks on them, and get the fuck out of here.
Wow, that's That's harsh.
First of all, this is not shitty tequila.
This is very good tequila.
family-run distillery.
Super high-end shit.
But I guess what really bums me out is I thought we got each other.
You know, you were my guys, you know? That guy.
Bin Laden.
He fucks.
You know what's hard about being a billionaire, Richard? You never know if someone likes you for you or for your money.
And I guess, with you it was all about the money, wasn't it, Richard? Don't you worry, I'll leave, and I'll even leave you the tequila because that's who I am.
But before I go, I want you to come outside and see something.
It's a gift.
Come on outside, everybody.
Just, I won't waste your time.
Just for a second.
No way.
A McLaren 650S Spider.
Yup, just like the one I had to sell when I dropped below a "B.
" Billion.
What do you think, Richard? You like it? Wow.
I I don't know what to say.
You got this for me? What? No, I It's for me.
I bought this for myself to celebrate you guys helping me get back to a billion.
That's why I came here, to show it to you.
To say thank you.
I'm not an asshole.
You drove here with a bow on it? No, I put it on after I parked.
I don't understand.
You got yourself a gift to prove that you're not an asshole? Right.
Um, sorry.
Hello.
This is Eshwar Singh, the CTO of Intersite.
What the fuck are you doing? You're deleting all my data.
What the hell? What the hell? - Fuck, I'm locked out of the system.
- So am I.
- We all are.
- It's just deleting everything.
You motherfuckers! It's fucking Seth.
Gilfoyle, you said you had this.
I thought I did.
I don't This is fucking impossible! You guys are killing me.
I'm losing hundreds of hours of content.
Yeah, well, we got hacked.
So, pull the plug.
Shut it down on your end.
I can't.
The disc is spinning at Now it's basically a fucking fork bomb, and you locked me out of my own system.
Okay, uh, Carla, shut it down.
None of the system shortcuts are responding.
Can't even SIGKILL the transfer.
It's like all of our keyboards are locked.
Okay, fucking Eshwar, I can't really problem solve this and talk to you on the phone at the same time, so Don't you dare fucking hang up on How the fuck did Seth do this? Well, you said he was harmless.
Obviously I was wrong.
He must be inside as root.
It's like he's right here in this house melting us down.
Can you guys just shut the fuck up? I'm trying to sleep.
Why the fuck would you smoke immediately after an anti-smoking pitch? - Why would you do that? Why? - It's a special occasion.
Go to your room! Fuck! Seth is single-handedly fucking the future of this company and there's nothing we can do about it! Make it stop.
Make it stop.
Make it stop! It just stopped deleting.
Hey, guys.
I think it's this.
- What the fuck? - It's happening again.
- No, no, no! Don't do that! - Take it off! Take it off! The Tres Comas bottle was on the delete key.
It was The corner of it.
It was just It just got on there.
That's not great But, good now.
Here you go.
I'm gonna I gotta go.
Did we delete over 9,000 hours of your premium content? Yes, we did.
And that is bad, certainly.
But the way we did it See, our compression is so incredibly powerful that we were able to delete all those files at a rate that until now was unthinkable if we're considering just raw speed.
Uh So, uh, just bear in mind, you know, when making your final decision, had EndFrame, uh, accidentally put a tequila bottle on their delete key, I guarantee, they would have struggled to delete half the amount of files that we did.
At best.
Or worst.
I could also I could uh I Worst.
- Definitely.
- Yeah.
Um But you know what? Um, I I, uh, I'm actually glad that we came here today, all of us, because this is good.
Because now more than ever, in these times meeting face-to-face Get out.
All of All of us or just Now.
All of you.
Okay.
Thank you for your time.
I would be remiss if I didn't mention that your sites are some of my primary destinations.
- Out.
- Okay.




******************************************
N/A - Binding Arbitration
Hey, could we get one more round, please? It's on a tab Bighetti.
- Sure.
Coming up.
- Cool.
Thanks.
Well, well, look who's the big shot.
Yeah, big shot.
How are you guys? Uh, everything good over at Nucleus? Nucleus is dog shit.
How do you do it, man? You used to be the most useless guy in the entire Nucleus team, but now you run an entire division.
Did you ever ask yourself why? No.
No, I never have.
Do you have any skill at all other than magically failing your way to the top? I have a boat.
I guess that's not really a skill.
Fucking Big Head, man.
Fucking Big Head.
Take care.
Oh, hey.
Hey, you forgot your phone.
At least I think this is your Holy shit.
Holy shit.
Right? This is Nucleus? Yep.
That is a beta of their entire mobile platform, and it sucks.
Yeah.
I mean, the UX is, like, Soviet-era.
When it stores photos, they actually get larger.
They never cracked middle-out.
I actually kind of wish you didn't show me this, because now I know we totally would have beaten them.
As it is now, I mean, we can't get funded.
All of our new coders quit.
I mean, can you even imagine what would happen if, like, a tech blog got their hands on that piece of shit? They'd tear it apart.
I mean, it could actually totally destroy Nucleus' release.
I bet Gavin would do, shit, anything to prevent that from happening, right? Yeah, totally.
Jesus, Richard, am I actually ahead of you on this? Take the phone, man.
It's yours.
Take it.
Are are you serious? Yeah, dude.
Come on, I owe you.
I mean, I was about to quit Hooli and move home.
And then Gavin promoted me just to spite you.
And now he keeps promoting me for some inexplicable reason.
I mean, I haven't done anything, Richard I mean, less than nothing.
Well, yeah.
But look at me now.
We're sitting on my boat, Richard, and that's because of you.
Soon we can sail it to fucking Hawaii or Sausalito.
Three more classes, and I get my boat license.
Oh, really? How many classes does it take? Three.
It's three classes.
I heard you can pay somebody to take the test for you, but I just haven't got around to it yet.
Enough with your coy bullshit, Richard, okay? I know you have my goddamn phone.
What the fuck do I have to do to get it back? Well, I was thinking that in exchange for my help, you I'm sorry, hold on.
You can't use the term "in exchange.
" It implies causality.
That's basically extortion.
Any actions he takes must be un-coerced and of his own volition.
Go.
Hello.
It's me again.
I was thinking that if you found your phone, you might be so happy that you would be inclined to drop the lawsuit.
Why would I do that? Because if you found your phone, that would mean that no tech bloggers or journalists did, and they couldn't write a scathing review based on what was on it, as it sucks.
Who knows? It might even cause Hooli stock to crash or certain careers to be ruined.
Richard, are you threatening me? Uh, am I threatening you? That's a good question.
Um, no.
If you don't give me my fucking phone back, I'm gonna find you, bend you over your desk and fuck you so hard, your front teeth Hold on.
You can't threaten him, especially not sexually.
This little shit could cause major damage here.
What am I allowed to say? Richard, it's me again.
Yes.
Here's my concern.
If my phone ends up in the hands of a journalist, Palo Alto Chief of Police Ed Gaskins, who, apropos of nothing, happens to be a close personal friend of mine, would have to go and ask this person where they got my phone.
Keep in mind, these aren't real journalists, Richard.
They're tech journalists.
Do you think they'd go to prison to protect their source? I don't either.
And since this phone's OS is a stolen prototype worth $40 to $60 million, you're looking at felony grand theft, Richard.
You can go to jail for 40 years.
Then again, you'd probably be fine in a full-blown hard time penitentiary.
I mean, after they waxed your rectum and knocked out all your front teeth just to make things easier.
You know, Gavin, if you don't want my help, then I guess we'll just see what happens.
All right, Richard.
So what do we do here? I don't know.
What do we do here? Paul, are you there? Ron? - Hey, buddy.
- Sam and Melinda there, too? They are.
They say hi.
Hey, Ron.
What up, kids? Let me hit you back in 10 and we'll sidebar this.
Binding arbitration? What's that? Well, it's like a trial but massively accelerated.
Next week we're gonna go in front of a retired judge and argue our whole lawsuit in just two days, and then we're done.
So this will all be resolved next week? I've always wanted to go to binding arbitration.
A weird thing to have always wanted to do.
Everybody who's ever sued me has settled out of court.
Pussies.
Now finally I'll be able to take the stand, be a part of the big show.
No show.
This is a serious legal proceeding, okay? And speaking to that, Ron Laflamme has got us a new litigator and we are meeting him in an hour.
Um, how are we gonna pay this person? Our guy has agreed to wave his entire fee until our case is resolved.
Oh, it's some wet behind the ears noob straight out of law school.
No, he is said to be very experienced, one of the best in the biz.
Then why the fuck would he take our case on spec? Was I in possession of cocaine, amphetamines, amyl nitrate, also known as poppers, at the time of my arrest? In large quantities.
Did I have consensual intercourse with two women under the age of 18? Repeatedly.
I admit this.
Did I violate the Mann Act and transport them across state lines for sexual purposes? Alleged but not proven.
And, boy, they tried.
They tried.
Therefore, I was incarcerated and I was disbarred.
Wait, hold on.
You were disbarred? So you can't practice law? Not in open court in the State of California.
That's correct.
But this is arbitration.
I'm really grateful for the opportunity.
I'm turning my life around.
I've served my time.
Questions? I guess I have one at least.
Um, what does amyl nitrate do? Oh, it dilates the anus.
That is accurate.
Also produces euphoria.
Okay, thank you, Pete and Jared.
- Sure.
- Anal dilation aside, what do you think of our case? You think we're gonna go in there and just dick-slap those Hooli pieces of shit? I have reviewed your case and it is extremely strong.
Thank God.
I do, every day of my life.
It's only by His grace that I was able to survive that plunge into the ravine and 11 months in the state penitentiary.
I'm sorry, were you in an emotional ravine or did you actually go into a ravine? Both.
Now, with your approval, I would like to move forward.
I currently am not in possession of an office and I'm residing in a halfway house, so I would like to give Hooli legal your home address.
Why? They need to send over their discovery documents, all of them.
All of them? This is craziness.
Couldn't they have just emailed all this? I mean, it's mostly just printed-out emails anyway.
Yeah, of course they could have.
And it would have been digitally searchable, and that is the point.
It's a classic document dump.
But what they didn't take into account is the power of us.
So grab a box, guys.
Start pulling anything you think is relevant.
And you may have to work pretty hard, but it will free us from this lawsuit.
Are you saying, "work will set you free"? Yes.
They have the manpower.
We have the perseverance.
Triumph of the will.
He's the most cheerful person I've ever heard quote Hitler.
So Hooli's entire intellectual property claim boils down to three simple questions.
Did your work on Pied Piper at any time overlap with your scope of work or Hooli business? Uh, no.
Did you ever do work on Pied Piper on Hooli time? Uh, no.
And at no time did you ever use Hooli equipment to develop Pied Piper in any way? No, never.
We're on our way then.
You just tell that honestly to the court, and we're home free.
Okay.
Unless, of course, you've offered a conflicting version of that to anyone A friend, your parents, a girlfriend.
No, no, and not possible.
I haven't had a girlfriend in, like, three years.
A boyfriend? No.
I'm not gay, just busy.
We're not litigating your sexuality.
That's good, yeah.
It's a good thing, too, because if we were, we'd all end up in prison.
Am I right? No offense.
Here, I did a first pass.
Let me know what you think.
Just a few questions for you to ask me while I'm on the stand.
It's rough clay.
We can shape it as we go.
You realize I have no intention of ever putting you on the stand? What? Why not? Well, I just don't think you have anything to offer the case.
They're trying to say that Pied Piper was created at Hooli, whereas I'm living proof that it was created here in my incubator.
I nurtured Richard like a little baby.
I was his patron, like the Borgias with Da Vinci.
Actually, the Medici were Da Vinci's patrons.
The Borgias poisoned people.
Say Medici again.
Medici.
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's how you pronounce it.
Let's be clear, okay? The burden of proof falls on Hooli here.
And they have none.
You have a Barrett 50-caliber rifle at your disposal that you can use to shoot Gavin Belson in the goddamn face.
And you're not gonna use it? What kind of fucking attorney are you? Well, technically, I can't refer to myself as an attorney until I'm reinstated and make restitution to my victims' families.
I'm a lawyer.
And I'm a good one.
And if you know one end of a Barrett 50-cal from the other, I'll eat a bowl of shit.
Did you get a taste for that on the inside, hmm? Hey, guys, it's been almost two weeks since the mother condor has been to the nest.
Do you think something may be wrong with the egg? Something is.
It's on our website.
No, really.
I mean, I think maybe I should call the museum, see if this is normal.
Jared, you want that egg to be alive, right? - Of course.
- Well, right now, because you don't know whether it is or not, it exists in both states, like Schrodinger's cat.
Like what? It's a quantum mechanics thought experiment that an Austrian physicist came up with to help understand quantum states.
So he imagined putting a cat into a box with poisoned food.
There's a 50/50 chance the cat eats it.
That does sound rather Austrian.
So, according to Schrodinger, if you open the box and confirm that the cat is dead, then in a sense, you've killed the cat.
Or if you call the museum and get the information, then you've killed the egg.
No, that's silly.
Is it? Okay.
I'm just gonna think about it for a minute.
Richard.
Yeah? - We have a problem.
- What's up? You and I are going into arbitration tomorrow.
I need you to look me right in the eye and tell me why you've been lying to me.
I haven't been lying to you.
You told me you haven't had a girlfriend for three years.
I have found at least 15 emails to Nelson Bighetti in the last year where you reference a girlfriend.
"Spent the day in bed with my girlfriend.
" "A homeless guy in the coffee shop almost stole my girlfriend.
" It's a joke.
Big Head and I We call my laptop my girlfriend because it's the only warm thing that's touched my crotch in a little while.
So when you said, quote, "My girlfriend shit the bed last night," that was your laptop? Laptop, yeah.
Well, that's good to hear.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Now listen to this.
April 10th, 11:14 P.
M.
"Taking my girlfriend to the Apple store.
" April 12th, 3:42 P.
M.
"Picking my girlfriend up at the mall.
" Yeah, so? So your laptop was in the shop for three days, right? The 10th through the 12th, right? Yeah, and? April 11th, 2:48 P.
M.
"Ran a test of the perceptual modeler during lunch, made a few tweaks and, wow, it's working on a whole new level.
" Yeah, that just means that it's going great, that it's working really well.
Richard, Richard, you didn't have your laptop with you at Hooli.
What computer did you use to run that test that day? Oh, shit.
Richard, you didn't use a Hooli computer? Tell me that you didn't use a Hooli fucking computer.
I I don't know.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Yes, I I think I did.
Fuck, I mean, I just used it once though, right? I mean, that's not That's not a big deal.
It's a huge deal.
We're done.
That's it.
- What's it? - God damn it.
Well, under the law, Hooli can lay claim to the underlying intellectual property that makes up Pied Piper.
So we're fucked now, is that it? We're totally fucked? Well, I mean, it all depends on whether or not the attorneys at Hooli figure out that your girlfriend is your laptop.
Are you telling us this entire case hinges on people believing that Richard had a girlfriend? We are fucked.
All right, this is gonna be a long two days, so let's try to keep things brief.
Your Honor, I think I can help speed things along.
We are willing to concede to all the numerous counts brought by Mr.
Belson, except the ones regarding the ownership of intellectual property.
Is that right? On the non-solicit violation, my client is willing to concede that Donald Dunn was improperly hired.
And on the unjust enrichment charge, Richard will agree to repay Hooli for the phone charger that he took home, and so on.
Thank you, Mr.
Monahan, for accelerating the process.
Okay, let's start this.
Plaintiff? Okay, Richard, here it goes.
They call you first, we're toast.
I think I'm gonna puke.
Your Honor, we'd like to call our first witness.
We would like to call Nelson Bighetti, a.
k.
a.
Big Head.
Wait, are you sure? 'Cause it says "no admittan" Okay.
Yeah, you were right.
It's this one.
Is that me? I'm sorry, Richard.
Firstly, sir, let me say it is a privilege to be speaking to someone as accomplished as you.
Okay.
You were one of the earliest members of the Pied Piper team, were you not? - Uh - And since your departure, your rise has been meteoric.
Haven't you received three Hooli promotions in a month? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I guess that is right.
It seems like everything you touch is made dramatically better, Mr.
Bighetti.
You make a meaningful and crucial contribution to everything you do, do you not? Wa wait.
I'm I'm sorry.
Do I not? Are you asking if I do do that or if I don't do that? This is amazing.
They have nothing.
It's a desperate play.
They're trying to build him up, make it seem like he was a crucial part of Pied Piper.
It's a Hail Mary.
They have nothing.
Because if I don't not do that, isn't that the same as - Let's move on.
- Okay.
Is it not true that Wired I'll rephrase.
Did Wired Magazine run a cover story on you? Yes or no? Oh, yes.
That did happen, yes.
I think I just made a mistake.
That was the museum.
I decided to call and check on the condor, and they said that it's very unlikely that the condor egg is still alive.
But my phone call itself drew their attention to their low viewing numbers and they've decided to take down the cameras today.
So by making the phone call, you've most likely killed the condor egg.
Oh, come on, I mean, that Schrodinger stuff's all just theoretical.
It doesn't apply here.
- Doesn't it? - I mean, look at Richard.
He didn't know that he had tested on a Hooli computer until Monahan opened that box of emails, right? So Richard was both innocent and guilty, but as soon as Monahan opened that box, it made Richard guilty.
But, I mean, by that logic, anyone who goes to an open-casket funeral is a murderer.
You are one dark motherfucker, Jared.
So, Mr.
Bighetti, you have stated that you didn't have anything to do with Pied Piper.
No.
I suppose you'd also say that you had nothing to do with Hooli XYZ either.
No, not really.
And what about the Hooli AIDS and Cancer Societies of which you were president? Did you have anything to do with those? Honestly, not really.
I actually remember when they told me I got the AIDS thing, for just a second I thought they were telling me that I had AIDS.
But then I realized, no, I was just the president of the AIDS thingy.
But for a second it was pretty scary there.
You see, Your Honor, Nelson Bighetti is pathologically modest.
While he humbly denies credit, the record shows that he had everything to do with all of these achievements.
It may be possible that Nelson actually believes he didn't have that much to do with the founding of Pied Piper either.
'Cause But it is painfully obvious that he had a huge hand in it.
No further questions, Your Honor.
May I say, Mr.
Bighetti, how refreshing it is to finally encounter someone in the tech community who is so free of pretension and ego? Well, that was troubling.
Yeah, what was that? It's just that he scored big points with the judge in there.
So what's our plan? Do we go in there and cross the shit out of him? Tear him a new hole in his butt? Let's just remind ourselves here that he gave me the phone and made this whole thing possible.
So let's take it easy on him.
Yeah, I don't think shredding him is the right way to go either.
Thank you.
It could backfire, turn the judge against us.
I have something else in mind.
Mr.
Bachmann, are you still prepared to testify? Fuck yes, I am.
Mr.
Bachmann.
Yes, sir? You are the owner and sole proprietor of the Palo Alto-based hacker hostel in which Mr.
Hendricks and Mr.
Bighetti both resided.
Is that correct? Yes, sir.
That is, in fact, correct.
It has been called the Garden of Tech Eden.
Is it also fair to say that every instinct you have as a businessman has been completely and totally wrong? - Sorry, what? - You hard of hearing, Mr.
Bachmann? No, I've heard everything Aren't you considered a joke in this town? I don't quite know where you're going with this.
Nor do I.
Can you tell us where you're headed here, Mr.
Monahan? Your Honor, if you are to accept Hooli's reverence for Mr.
Bighetti as proof that he's a genius, then you must also accept Mr.
Bachmann's reverence for Mr.
Bighetti as proof that he's a moron.
I'm simply establishing this type of logic, Your Honor, cuts both ways.
I see.
I'll allow it.
Really? Because I don't Mr.
Bachmann, you have incubated a seemingly endless string of patently unsuccessful apps, haven't you? No.
No, that is not correct.
I incubated Pied Piper.
I saw the value in that.
Oh, did you? Isn't it true that you were about to evict Mr.
Hendricks until he became the subject of a bidding war? You disliked Pied Piper The one app in your hostel that showed promise.
Well, I think that's a bit harsh.
I mean, ev In fact, you tried to encourage Mr.
Hendricks to change his app to be more like Mr.
Bighetti's horrendous app called Nip Alert.
Isn't that true? Well, yes, I thought Nip Alert showed great promise.
It did not show great promise.
What it showed was the location of nearby women possessing erect nipples.
And as such, Mr.
Bighetti's grotesque creation was passed over by every investor in this town except you, because it was perverted.
Well, I'll admit that I'll concede that the cultural moment may have passed, but at the time No, at the time, it was as misogynistic as it is now, wasn't it, Mr.
Bachmann? It yes, it had some major problems Some major problems? Mr.
Bachmann, a few moments ago you said that it showed great promise.
You said that.
I can have the court reporter read it back to you, Mr.
Bachmann.
I don't need her to read it back to me.
I can remember Nip Alert was poorly conceived and riddled with bugs, wasn't it? Well, all apps in the beginning Mr.
Bachmann, answer the question.
You liked Nip Alert, and it was terrible.
- No, I I - Didn't you? - Liking it - Mr.
Bachmann, you liked it, didn't you? Okay, yes, yes! Fine! Yes, I liked it, even though it was a terrible app and it had no market potential.
I was high when he pitched it and I like nipples Thank you, Mr.
Bachmann.
It was a buggy, rapey piece of shit designed by an idiot.
- Mr.
Bachmann, thank you very much.
- It was so bad that the first time that Richard tried to boot it up on his system, it crashed his laptop.
It was in the shop for three days.
'Cause it was a piece of shit! That I mean, among other things that weren't that were reasons why it was bad.
No more questions, Your Honor.
What the fuck is going on here? I don't know what happened.
He got in my head.
It's a very uncharacteristic error.
They're calling you next, Richard.
They want you on the stand in 10 minutes.
Great.
So they figured it out.
We're fucked, aren't we? It looks that way.
Damn it, they're gonna ask me if I ran a test of Pied Piper on a Hooli computer, and I'm gonna have to say yes.
What if you said no? What are you talking about? Are you saying I should lie on the stand or something? Gentlemen, the less I know about this, the better.
Well, then it appears we're in good hands, because you don't seem to know shit.
You're a mean and terrible attorney.
I'm not an attorney.
Richard, all they know is that you didn't have your laptop when you ran that test, so just tell them that you borrowed my laptop or you came home for lunch and used my computer.
Whatever you say, I'll get back on the stand and then back you up.
That would be committing perjury.
That would be lying under oath.
If you don't lie, Richard, you lose.
We lose everything The company, be a billion dollars I mean, you know, because I have 10%.
I know.
God damn it, I know.
Richard, do the right thing here.
Lie on the stand.
Mr.
Hendricks, you are heterosexual, yes? Uh, yes.
How long has it been since you were in a relationship with a woman, Mr.
Hendricks? Two years? Three? Uh, yeah, that sounds about right, I guess.
You're under oath.
Um, longer.
So you've definitely had no girlfriend in the past three years? This seems needlessly cruel.
We all get it.
Mr.
Hendricks, when you refer to a girlfriend in these emails to Mr.
Bighetti, to what are you referring? My laptop computer.
The same laptop that Mr.
Bachmann just told us was in a shop for three days from April 10th to the 12th of last year? Yes.
Can we get to the point, please? Mr.
Hendricks, did you at any time use a Hooli computer to test and/or alter your Pied Piper algorithm? You're under oath.
I just I just wanted to be different.
I wanted Pied Piper to be different.
But if this company is built on lies, then we're really not much different than Hooli.
The law says that I lose everything My whole company, everything that I worked for Because I used one Hooli computer to test and modify one block.
Is that right? I mean, is that Is that fair? To me, if the system says that's fair, then I guess I'm probably not meant to be a part of it.
Mr.
Hendricks, please answer the question.
Did you at any time use a Hooli computer Yes.
Yeah, I did.
I made a mistake and I did.
I used a Hooli computer to work on my algorithm one time.
And so here you go.
It's okay, Richard.
You don't have to protect me anymore.
I'm his girlfriend.
Sit down, Mr.
Bachmann.
Judge, objection! I was the one that was in the shop for those three days 'cause he had hit it so hard, I needed a doctor.
Sit down, Mr.
Bachmann.
Hey, has anyone heard from Richard? Should I text him to see how the arbitration's going? Uh, you can.
But right now it's going both well and poorly.
And if you get definitive information back and it's bad, I could argue that you have effectively caused us to lose the arbitration.
Oh, he's taking it down.
All right, I am unclipped.
If you're watching, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna go ahead and leave this egg here.
This camera does need to come down.
That's good.
He's leaving the egg.
The bolts are all rusted out here.
You should have never called that museum, Jared.
They're on there pretty good.
Holy shit.
Jared, you just killed that guy.
I just got a text from Richard.
I'm not gonna read it.

N/A - Two Days of The Condor

Hello? Can anyone hear me? This is unbelievable.
There are seven thousand people watching this stream, and it's working flawlessly.
Rebuffering events are below 0.
5%.
Even when his sobbing shakes the camera there's no blocking at all.
And the quality is great.
Why? More good news.
There's a storm coming.
There's no way the EMS guys can get up there.
This could go on all day.
Appreciate your cooperation here, gentlemen.
We'll see you this afternoon.
Richard, I'm sorry about that.
No, it's fine.
The lead counsel of the company that's suing us just marched their engineer through the house to make sure the platform they want to seize is ready for them.
That felt great.
It's like they assume they've already won.
Is there any chance they haven't? Goddammit, Richard.
In addition to stealing two of my four packs of Fage yogurt, your ship-jumping coder cunts happened to walk off with the rest of our toilet paper, so that Hmm.
Speaking of shit that can't be wiped away and flushed, how are you, Mr.
"Mohanahan"? Morning, Mr.
Bachman.
I don't suppose you have anything to say to me by way of an apology? For? For the embarrassing ordeal that you put me through yesterday in front of over nine people.
I think you should be the one apologizing, Mr.
Bachman.
You lost your composure and ruined our entire case.
I'll see you gentlemen at 3:00.
I shan't be attending out of contempt, so this will have to serve as our goodbye.
Don't let the door hit ya where God split ya.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
Richard, I'll see you there? Yeah.
Pete? Do we have any chance of winning this? When you hired me, I told you I would never lie to you, Richard.
Yeah, that's true.
You did.
I'll see you at 3:00.
Oh, hello, neighbor.
Neighbor.
Not for long.
Louise helped me sell my house.
The ferret laws are much more enlightened in Arizona.
Arizona, huh? You'll be dead in a month.
We'll miss you.
This your home? Indeed it is.
Are you interested in selling? It's a great time.
Not interested.
There are people in there who depend on me.
Human people.
Not weasel animals.
It's a ferret.
- Weasels.
- Ferrets! Corner lot, good square footage.
I could probably get you a lot more than I got Noah.
How much did you get him? Wait.
You're selling the house just like that? It wasn't a rash decision.
I agonized over it.
But what about your incubator? What about it, Jared? Pied Piper has caked its pants, Jian-Yang's chances of investment have literally gone up in smoke, and you heard what Monahan said in court yesterday.
Market forces and random events have conspired against me to make the success of my incubator all but impossible.
Functionally, all I've really achieved is running a flop house where guys have shat, jerked off, and paid me no rent.
Why won't anyone come get me? Well, we have accomplished one other thing.
We're up over 20,000 viewers.
Holy shit.
Really? Buzzfeed linked to us.
Now we're picking up on Reddit.
This guy falling off a cliff is the first good luck we've had.
And right as we're gaining traction, we have to hand it all over to Gavin fucking Belson.
This is fucked.
We can't give it to him if we don't have it to give.
What do you mean? We do have it, and we have to give it.
exists digitally on servers in this house.
If we nuke them, there's nothing for him to seize.
As far as he knows, it's an accident.
No one would believe that.
Two weeks ago, we accidentally erased one-third of Intersite's entire library.
I think we've established our ineptitude beyond a reasonable doubt.
Fuck it.
I say we delete everything.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Guys, that's not what we do.
We don't destroy things.
Not on purpose, anyway.
Right? Isn't that the whole reason why you got into this in the first place, to build cool shit? I mean, look at that livestream.
It's fucking perfect.
And even if Hooli ends up owning it, we built it with no resources and a fucking stream of endless obstacles.
I don't know, I mean, I kind of want to see how big it can get, right up until the point where Gavin Belson has to fucking take it from us.
Guys, who is Manny "Pa-qui-oh"? Pacquiao? He's one of the most famous people on the planet earth.
Oh! Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino legislator.
No, boxer.
Okay, well, he just tweeted a link to our livestream, and he has almost two million followers.
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
We got to scale up if we're going to handle that kind of traffic.
I'm gonna compress the manifests.
I'll kill the highest bitrate to give us more headroom.
I've always wanted to be part of a suicide pact.
What? That's not what we're doing.
Hey, Gilfoyle, we're up to 50,000 views.
Whoa, it is, like, 500 degrees in here.
Yeah.
Anton is really starting to sweat.
Yeah, I still can't believe you gave the servers a man's name.
Sorry, I couldn't remember your mother's name.
Hey, why don't I just open up the garage door? Let some fresh air in here.
Yeah, sure, if you want the cooling system to shut down and everything in here to turn to magma.
Actually, with all the new servers I have running, we're about to max out the amperage and blow the main breaker anyway.
Sooner or later, Gilfoyle's servers are gonna fail, and then it's all done.
My servers can handle 10 times the traffic if they weren't busy apologizing for your shit codebase.
Oh, yeah? Well, my codebase could handle this traffic, fuck your mother, make a video of it, upload it, and even that video would not even buffer.
Hey, Pete.
Hey, I just heard from the judge.
He's gonna call us in an hour early.
Early? What does that mean? Well, it's either a very good or a very bad sign.
Well, actually, it's almost always bad.
I take it back.
It's a bad thing.
Why don't you head over, I'll see you when you get there, okay? Hey, guys, I gotta go.
It's time.
Try to keep it online as long as you can, okay? Why? - The picture quality is remarkable.
- Mm-hmm.
And this is all hosted at a data center they built themselves in their garage.
- Please help me.
- That's right.
- Very impressive.
- Please someone help me! It's already becoming a meme in the Philippines.
Look.
Why won't anyone come help me? Can anyone hear me? Hello? And Filipinos find this amusing? - Can anyone hear me? - Apparently.
Please help me.
I've lost all feeling below the waist.
- Why? - They are a fascinating people.
How are the numbers? Unless people start getting bored and tuning out, we're gonna hit our capacity.
Fuck.
I'm so dehydrated.
I'm gonna have to urinate into my water bottle.
This guy's gonna drink his own piss? That's too good.
We're gonna fail by succeeding.
Jared, I need you to plug those servers in now.
Aye-aye, captain.
What a shit-circus.
Good riddance.
You're never gonna sell.
- What? - Look what's happening here.
It's magical.
The only thing magical is how much this house has appreciated in the last three years, Jared.
I'm selling.
That's just money.
It has no real value.
It literally defines value.
Look at this check.
All right? You can't actually cash it, but think about what it represents.
It's priceless.
Jared, I saw your entire HR file.
It was in the Hooli disclosure.
You had a fat salary and stock options.
By now, you would be a senior VP.
But instead, you walked away to wrangle extension cords for a company that will be defunct in maybe 30 hours.
If you're not kicking yourself even just a little bit, you are objectively insane.
I can always find another job, but look at us doing this.
It's intoxicating.
Don't act like it's not magical.
It is.
What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ! What the fucking fuck? Hey, guys.
On the day that I'm showing the place? Are you serious? I had to shorten up the cable run, so This is the shortest distance to the garage.
Had to do it.
It's magical.
Huh.
So, start with the wide end.
Oh, Richard.
Here, let me help you with that.
May I? - Relax.
- Okay.
Just gonna tie your tie.
All right.
I feel terrible it's come to this, Richard.
But who knows? Sometimes things like this are for the best.
I know this one is for me.
If you hadn't blackmailed me into this arbitration, I was gonna have to go in front of the Hooli Board of Directors and ask for $250 million to buy you out.
Wow.
$250 million? Believe it or not, your algorithm is the only way to make Nucleus work.
I was ready to pay whatever it took.
Let me ask you this.
If I offered you 10 million for Pied Piper right now, before we even go in there, would you take it? Really? You'd do that? No, of course not.
I'm about to get it for free.
I'm just fucking with you.
I'm sure you'll come up with plenty more once-in-a-lifetime ideas, Richard.
Or not.
There you go.
Good luck in there, Richard.
Gilfoyle, what are you doing? Jamming the breakers so they don't trip.
That's not a huge fucking fire hazard? Yeah, of course it is.
This whole shit box could go up at any second.
No.
No fires in here.
I already had that conversation with Jian-Yang, I think.
Gilfoyle, we need to build the caching mechanisms now! It's the only way the clusters will scale.
Okay, sounds good.
Do it.
I can't do it on my own, Gilfoyle! Hey, Erlich, I need another coder here! None of these guys can help me.
Sorry, amigo.
I don't code anymore.
Remember? Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
Well, then we're fucked.
This thing is gonna crash any second.
Mr.
Bachman, I am sorry to drop in on you like this - Erlich, Seriously! - But I have got the buyers here.
Shit.
He's gonna drink his own piss.
- Gilfoyle, I need some fucking help! - Sorry, Louise, this isn't a great time.
I'm entertaining and I have some minor cosmetic repairs to do before I show the house.
Oh, no, they don't even need to look inside.
They only want the property for the lot value.
- Seriously, I can't do this by myself! - Lot value? Meaning? You have to realize your house is a total teardown, right? They want to tear this place down? Gilfoyle, the caching mechanisms! We're gonna crash! - I told you, get Erlich to do it! - Richard said keep it online! - I can't do this by myself! - Mr.
Bachman they want to make an offer right now.
All cash.
Mr.
Bachman, I think you would be foolish to turn this down.
Did you just call me a fool? - No.
All I meant was - Madam, you do not call a man a fool on the transom of his own home.
A home that happens to be the world headquarters of a company keeping streaming video of a man who's about to drink his own urine online for tens of thousands of Filipinos.
Does that sound like foolishness to you? So, you can tell your clients, respectfully, that they may go fuck themselves.
All right, I'm gonna start compiling varnish to cache the manifest.
Dinesh, you reduce the seeds in the P2P swarm, got it? Let's fucking do this.
I knew you wouldn't sell.
Jared, respectfully, shut the fuck up.
I'm working.
I don't wanna drink my pee.
What's that smell? Which I weighed in making my final decision.
A decision I do not take lightly.
Now, in concerning Mr.
Hendricks, are you on your phone? No.
It says, "Aim at the base of the fire.
" That's the servers.
If you hit those servers, you kill our livestream, Jared.
I don't know what to do.
- Should we do verbal SWOT analysis? - 298,000! 299,000! Our check is burning.
He's drinking his own urine.
He's drinking his piss.
We're up over 300,000 viewers! Hello? I'm down here! Hello? Wait, who the fuck is that guy? Wait, wait.
They're rescuing him.
Why did it take you so long? Wait.
He shut it off.
It's over.
Holy shit.
- We did it.
- We fucking did it.
We stayed online till the end.
Look at that.
Fuck, yeah.
Oh! I wonder if Richard got to see that.
Which is why I had no recourse but to rule that, since Mr.
Hendricks, by his own admission, used Hooli equipment to facilitate the development of Pied Piper, then pursuant to California Labor Code, Hooli has a right to ownership of Pied Piper's underlying IP.
Congrats.
Congratulations.
- Very well done.
- Congratulations.
Richard, I'm sorry.
I really am.
We're now at 78 viewers, which still seems high.
Like, who's watching a blank screen? We never went down, gents.
Anton really carried us.
One, still a weird name, and two, this was a win for our software stack.
Your software can choke on my fat fucking balls.
Guys Richard just texted me.
He says delete it.
- What? - He says, "We just lost.
It's my company.
Delete it all.
Now.
" Motherfucker.
Now, Pied Piper, you conceded on all of these minor counts.
Accordingly, on the count of wrongful solicitation, I find Richard Hendricks did indeed breach his contract with Hooli when he hired away a Hooli employee, one Donald Dunn, AKA Jared, AKA O.
J.
, apparently.
But this is where things get interesting.
Mr.
Belson, there is language in this contract that the California Supreme Court has deemed unlawful.
Preventing Mr.
Dunn from seeking employment elsewhere is a violation of his rights.
Are you aware of this? I was not, but I'm willing to drop that count altogether if it makes things easier.
Well, here's the thing.
This clause was unlawful when you included it in Mr.
Hendricks' employment agreement.
Right.
As I said, I'm willing to just move past this.
See, again, I don't think you understand.
If Mr.
Hendricks hadn't hired Mr.
Dunn, or you hadn't pursued him for that hire, I'm not sure I would've noticed the violation.
But you did, so I did.
What's happening? Justice, baby.
And what I find is, this is an unenforceable contract.
It is null and void.
So, effectively, Mr.
Hendricks never had a valid employment agreement with Hooli.
As a result, Hooli has no claim to ownership of Pied Piper's underlying IP.
That is my ruling and per your arbitration agreement, it is binding and final.
Thank you, everyone.
What the fuck just happened? We lost? You gotta be fucking kidding me! We won.
We won, right? I mean, Pied Piper is ours? Richard, not long ago, emergency workers pulled me out of the flaming wreckage of my Mercury Grand Marquis.
All right.
Today, you pulled me out of the flaming wreckage of my life, and those flames burn far hotter.
- Sure.
- For that, I thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.
I used to take a tampon, soak it in grain alcohol, and stick it up into my rectum.
That got me high, Richard, but not half as high as the drug you just gave me.
You know what that drug's called? No.
A second chance.
Right on.
Uh Well, thank you.
You did great.
Great job.
Wow! I mean, I totally thought we were gonna lose that.
I actually told the guys to Oh my god.
All right, I just wrote a mod of DBAN.
As soon as we run it, it will delete the entire code repository.
Pied Piper will literally vanish.
Wait, what? What? No.
No, no, no.
Fuck! Are we sure we have to do this? You read the text, Jared.
If anything had changed, Richard would have called by now.
Right? Shit, no! Goddammit.
So all you have to do is press that button, and the entire platform's obliterated.
And no one will ever be able to recover it.
Yep, one click and poof.
"The power to destroy a thing "is the absolute control over it.
" Frank Herbert, "Dune.
" All right then.
Here we go.
Three, two, one Wait, wait.
Shouldn't we drink one last toast to Pied Piper before we burn it to the fucking ground? All right.
As long as God isn't involved and there's beer.
Okay.
Okay.
But if we're claiming this happened before the ruling, we should do it quickly.
Damn.
Hey, I need to use your phone.
Sorry, I can only allow that for customers.
I'm just gonna use it.
Shit.
I don't know any of their numbers.
They're all on my phone.
Goddammit.
Fuck.
I need to use your phone to email my friend so he doesn't delete Pied Piper.
Please.
Bus? Okay.
To Pied Piper.
Wait, is this a wheat beer? I can't drink this without a lemon.
Noah's got a lemon tree.
Fuck him over one last time? Okay, but then we're then we're gonna do it.
Yeah.
Thank you so much for letting me use your phone.
Just one e-mail and I'm done, I swear.
As long as you don't shit, piss, or puke on my bus, it's all good.
Okay.
I hope it's not weird that the email's coming from your account.
I did not know lemon trees had thorns.
Wait.
This one has like a bruise on it.
No response.
Nothing.
Fuck.
Hey, thanks.
Don't get that shitty one.
Get that nice one up there.
Yeah, I think the ferrets have nibbled some of the lower ones.
Okay, there's no way I could have squirted this lemon in your eye on purpose from this distance.
I'm not a fucking lemon sniper.
You'd be more of a lemon suicide bomber.
- Guys.
- Guys! It's Richard.
Why is he knocking? He has my keys.
We need to delete it before he comes in.
Let me in! Richard.
Richard.
Don't delete it.
Don't delete it.
Did you delete it? Oops.
Oops? What does that mean? Oops? You said "delete.
" Fuck.
Oh, wait.
- Hold on.
- What? Gilfoyle, what's happening? What? That's weird.
Kernel panic.
The whole system just crashed.
So, what does that mean? Did you delete Pied Piper or not? Nope.
We definitely did not.
All thanks to Dinesh's garbage code.
The software you wrote to delete our software just shit the bed.
No surprise.
No, my software's fine.
It's 'cause it's running on your shit hardware.
My hardware handled everything else just fine - It caught fucking fire! - Until your shit software spread like a virus and killed it.
- Restart it.
- Oh, I will restart it.
No, don't restart it.
Don't restart it.
We won.
We won? - We won? - Yeah, we beat Gavin Belson, and we won.
Holy shit.
We won.
What the fuck happened here? Magic.
Gilfoyle's shit hardware caught fire.
No, 'cause your shit software was slowing it down.
And then Erlich coded and it gave me chills.
Gilfoyle made a hole in the wall.
Look! - I did.
- It was frightening.
You hear he just lost the Pied Piper suit? That's nothing.
They're saying half of all Hooli employment agreements may be legally invalid.
You don't think the board will get rid of him, do you? Maybe.
- Two, please.
- Sure, coming right up.
I'm hearing a lot of chatter about that Nelson Bighetti guy over at XYZ.
I mean, three promotions in a year? President of Hooli Cancer and AIDS societies? That doesn't just happen.
He must be smart as hell.
Gavin, come in.
Motherfuck.
Wait, what? I am rarely wrong about these things.
You have an aura about you.
An aura that if carefully managed by someone with the necessary spiritual expertise, could be harnessed to great effect.
Okay.
Monica.
Russ, what are you doing here? Question.
What's got two thumbs and three commas? This guy.
- What? - Yeah.
Like, 10 minutes after boy genius won his lawsuit, your boss lady gave me a call.
We just did a deal.
She put me back over a "B.
" Mmm.
It means a billion.
Yeah, got it.
I got a lot of cars, you know, if you want to go for a drive some time.
Got my own.
Does it go like this? Does it go like this? No? Think about it.
Laurie, I just ran into Russ Hanneman leaving.
He said you made him some kind of a deal.
Yes.
He was substantially difficult.
Truly repugnant.
And when we finalized our agreement, he described his erection to me.
But in the end, I managed to buy 100% of his interest in Pied Piper.
Let us never speak of him again.
Well, that is fine by me, and I'm so glad you got him away from Pied Piper.
I mean, now that their suit has been resolved, I think that they're about to become something really special.
Their core technology, it's visionary.
- Absolutely.
- Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.
This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.
Right.
Russ has two board seats.
He did.
Now, Hendricks votes one, Bachman votes one, and we, at Raviga, we vote three.
That is a majority.
We can now take the necessary steps to ensure that Pied Piper is properly managed.
What What're you saying? I don't understand.
Monica, I believe you do.
Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! That was a long one.
It's not the first time I've heard that.
Monica, what's up? When are you getting here? The party has already started, and it's getting pretty crazy.
You have to smoke weed.
- What's wrong? - This is the best day of my life.
- Um, okay.
- And yet, no girls.
- There's nothing to it, it's just luck.
- Okay, well, then do it.
Beat my 43.
- Beat my 43.
- I'd like to smoke weed.
That's the difference between you and me, you smoke weed all day, I learn a valuable skill.
Richard, are you okay? Yeah, who died? Um What just happened? Well, apparently, Raviga held an emergency meeting of Pied Piper's Board of Directors Oh, no.
And they voted to remove me as CEO of my own company.
I just got fired.
And what about me?
******************************************
N/A - Founder Friendly

I just got fired.
And what about me? What about you? What about me? Okay.
That's it.
I'm going over there right fucking now, before they leave.
Erlich, I'm gonna use your car.
Jared, you call Ron LaFlamme, tell him to meet me there.
Fuck these assholes! Wait.
Richard, I'm coming with you.
Here.
Jared, clear this.
Get all the smoke out of it.
- Otherwise, it damages the device.
- Umm Don't be a pussy.
How could they do this? How could they fire me from my own company? Just stay calm.
We're gonna fight this.
Jesus, Richard, slow down.
Stop, stop, stop! Did I just hit a deer? No, goddamn it! Fucking Stanford Robotics.
Shit.
Is this gonna make us late? Oh! They killed the Bam-bot.
Fuck your Bam-bot! You little Stanford cunts fucked up my grille! - Fucking piece of shit! - Wait.
You little cunt! - Fuck! - Hey.
This one's for your mama.
Erlich, stop.
Come on.
Erlich, we've got to get to Raviga.
Hey, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey.
Thanks for coming, Ron.
I'd bail on spin class any day for you, Richie.
Richard.
Richard.
I kept calling, you weren't answering.
Talk to the hand, Monica.
Richard, can you stop? I can explain, okay? It's pretty self-explanatory, Monica.
You voted to fire me.
What the fuck? I mean, there is no way I'm letting you push me out of this.
Our intention is not to push you out.
We wish rather to transition you to a more appropriate role within the company.
A new CEO will be brought in to manage day-to-day operations while you assume the role of Chief Technology Officer.
Congratulations.
CTO? Yes.
You want me to be an employee at my own company? You would still be in charge of the engineering, and you'd continue vesting your shares, and keep your board seat.
The same seat I had an hour ago when you voted to fire me as CEO? - That came in handy.
- Richard, please.
I realize this may be bittersweet, but earlier this evening Raviga decided to officially fund Pied Piper Series A Round at $5 million at a $50 million valuation.
Essentially, you have created a company that is too valuable for you to run.
You should feel good about that.
Are you kidding me? I made the company, okay? I'm the one who came up with the name "Pied Piper.
" Yeah.
Ron, can I have a word please? They can't really do this, can they? I think they just did.
You remember that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman, and I said, "Hey, Richie, this is a shit deal," but you took it anyway because you wanted to do something crazy for once in your life? Yes, I remember.
Well, you basically just loaded a gun and handed it to Hanneman, and Hanneman sold that gun to Raviga, and then Raviga just fucking pistol-whipped you.
But hey, at least they're letting you keep your shares and your board seat.
You lose a little blood with the dilution for the new CEO, but I've seen worse.
Like that shit deal you brought me from Hanneman.
If we give Richard a little bit of space, he'll be able to wrap his head around this, and a smooth transition to a new CEO will be possible.
To wit, I served as the CEO of Aviat Mr.
Bachman.
In the version of Pied Piper in which I am invested, you will not be CEO.
Not now.
Not ever.
Well, you, madam, are a shrew of the first order.
Okay.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I'm gonna fight it.
I understand you're upset.
As you can see, this is a very emotional time for me as well, but we have some very strong candidates coming in for the CEO position, and we would so appreciate your input.
- My input? - Mmm.
You want me to help you pick my new replacement? I'd rather quit.
And I don't care how much money I lose, because I am gonna get it all back when I sue the living shit out of you! Okay.
All right.
All right.
Ron, let's go.
Sorry, I'm forced to inform you that I can no longer provide you with legal counsel.
What are you talking about? You're my attorney.
No.
Technically, I'm Pied Piper's corporate counsel, and you just declared your intention to walk.
So, in effect, you kind of just threatened to sue me, and I don't take kindly to threats, Mr.
Hendricks.
"Mr.
Hendricks"? What happened to "Richie"? Unfortunately, I'm not at liberty to discuss him with you either, Mr.
Hendricks.
Richard, if I didn't vote to remove you, then Laurie would've adjourned the meeting, replaced my seat on the board with someone else at Raviga, and then they would've voted to remove you.
At least this way, I'm still in the game.
No.
You mean, at least this way, you kept your job.
At least the actual Judas had the courtesy to kill himself after betraying his leader, Jesus Christ.
He's the CEO of the world.
Ever heard of him? Yeah.
Got it.
Went to Catholic school.
Really? How long? Look, I'm still on the board of this company.
I'll be in all of the meetings.
Maybe I can be helpful at some point.
You wanna be helpful, Monica? Convince Laurie to keep me on as CEO.
Look, I know I made some mistakes.
I wasn't perfect, but I'll get better.
I'll even go to one of those CEO coaches, like that guy at fucking Twitter.
Richard, it's done.
Laurie already found a new CEO.
What? Already? You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process, so they picked someone this morning.
Jack Barker.
He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.
I don't care who he is, okay? None of us do.
"Action" Jack Barker? Seriously? They picked that gray-haired fossil over me? You said you turned the job down.
I said it was mutual.
Oh.
What? That's accurate.
He ran Entercross Systems.
They IPO'ed in 1998 for more than a billion dollars.
Yeah, 20 fucking years ago.
Tech 1.
0.
What has he done lately? After that, he ran Turnwire for four years until it was acquired by Microsoft for $2 billion.
Holy shit.
This guy's a hitter.
He was, in the oughts.
What's he done in the 20-teens? Looks like he started a foundation in his mother's name to cure cancer.
Yeah, how's that going? Yeah.
I bet his mother's dead.
Yeah, that's probably why he started the foundation.
Richard, Laurie's meeting with him tomorrow.
You should come in and talk with him.
No fucking way.
Think this through.
I mean, you have to know that you can't start another compression company.
No VC will fund that out of fear of being sued, and unless you have some totally different, game-changing idea lying around So you're saying that I'm fucked if I leave? No, I'm saying that Okay.
Well, then I guess I'm fucked, because I'm out.
And when I leave, Jared's out, Dinesh is out, Gilfoyle is out.
Everybody's out.
So good luck with the company there, Monica.
It'll just be you, Laurie Bream, and some fucking asshole who can't even cure cancer.
He's right.
Where Richard goes, I go.
Monica, excuse how high I am, but are the uniforms in Catholic schools as low-cut as they are online? Fuck off.
Did you tell Richard you were out? No.
Did you? No.
Are we out? Hmm.
Did Gavin tell you what this is about? We haven't spoken in some time.
Thank you all for coming on such short notice.
I have a difficult announcement to make.
We, in the tech business, often refer to failure as a good thing.
Failure is growth.
Failure is learning.
But sometimes failure is just failure.
I think I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would be this hard.
But goodbyes are always hard, especially when I am the one saying goodbye.
Today, effective immediately, I, Gavin Belson, founder and CEO of Hooli, am forced to officially say goodbye to the entire Nucleus division.
All Nucleus personnel will be given proper notice and terminated.
But make no mistake.
Though they're the ones leaving, it is I who must remain and bear the heavy burden of their failure.
It is my fault.
I trusted them to get the job done.
But that is the price of leadership.
Thank you.
That was the gutsiest thing I've ever seen.
Amazing.
So, wait, does that mean Uh Denpok? Can I have your Big Gulp? I know we keep saying this, but even though Richard is a great guy And a brilliant coder.
He's wonderful.
Nevertheless, he is lacking in certain managerial capacities.
- Totally fair.
- It's fair, right? He's still a great coder.
And an amazing human being.
- Okay, look.
- Such We have a lot of shit we want to say about him.
Do we have to keep prefacing it with all this nice-guy stuff? I mean, if so, we're gonna be here all night.
Yeah, we kind of do, though, just to offset the shittiness of all the shitty stuff.
What if we use like a dictionary patch? To compress all the nice-guy stuff.
Like an acronym.
Exactly.
"Richard is great, but you know" R-I-G-B-Y.
Rigby.
Rigby is all the nice-guy stuff.
Okay.
Rigby.
But he just assumed we were gonna leave with him, which is kind of total bullshit, right? That's really arrogant.
Rigby.
We gave up our own apps so that we could bust our asses for him.
Why the fuck should we give up our Pied Piper shares right when we get funded because he's too much of a prima donna to let someone experienced come in and run the company the way its supposed to be run.
- Rigby.
- Rigby.
Now I'm actually getting kind of fucking angry! I mean, we put in so much work for no pay, and now he thinks he's gonna walk out on us? I mean, seriously, fuck that guy.
Fuck him.
Rigby.
What are we gonna do? - Rigby.
- Rigby.
Richard, I have something that might cheer you up.
What is this? Go on, Gloomy Gus, open it.
Okay.
So this is a box of files with companies' information on it? No.
These are all companies that I took the liberty of reaching out to that are actually offering you the job of CTO.
Really? Some of these companies are pretty good.
Flutterbeam's like really good.
Of course it is.
They all are.
You're the belle of the ball, and these are all your swains, hoping for a glimpse of ankle.
Ah.
The nest wherein the asp doth coil.
Where's Richard? Is he coming? Nope.
Congratulations, you've successfully broken a good man.
Is that Barker? Uh yeah.
What are you gonna do? I just spent the last 16 hours cherry-picking Friars Roasts for the premium old-man jokes.
Essentially, I'm going to beat him to death with his own titanium hips.
Not just for me, but for Richard.
Jack Barker, aka Action Jack.
We meet at last.
Erlich Bachman.
Mr.
Bachman.
Pleasure to finally meet you.
I'm a big fan.
Oh, really? Of what? Metamucil? Polio? The phonograph? A nice piece of fish? Segregated water fountains? Senior citizen discounts at Perkins Family restaurants? Erectile dysfunction because of corroded penile arteries? Deviled eggs as an entrée? Liking Ike? No.
None of those, Mr.
Bachman.
I am a fan of yours.
Have been ever since you were at the helm of Aviato.
You know Aviato? Yes.
Aviato.
My Aviato? Is there any other Aviato? Well, legally, there cannot be.
Mr.
Barker, pleasure to meet you.
- Is that a poppy seed muffin? - Yes, sir.
Well, Poppy wants one 'cause Mommy already got hers.
Hooli stock jumped seven percent today on this news that Gavin Belson is writing down the entire Nucleus project.
What's happening here? It was a courageous move.
He's a straight shooter, and obviously Wall Street is responding to that.
So, what else do you think So, by our account, just under 50 percent of Hooli employment agreements include a non-compete clause.
The same clause that caused us to lose the Pied Piper lawsuit in arbitration and are thus legally invalid, calling into question some of our IP ownership.
Shit.
I was afraid of that.
But hypothetically, this also presents an opportunity.
Any of those people could be dismissed with no severance.
Any unvested stock would return to the company option pool.
So, in other words, we have the right to terminate any of those people with no repercussions whatsoever, and we'd actually make money? Correct.
You know, our annual individual performance reviews showed a 20 percent incidence of sub-standard work.
So essentially, one out of every five Hooli team members deserve to be fired.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What? So, are you nervous? No, actually.
I feel pretty good.
Flutterbeam was the best company we looked at.
Their tech is great.
Their offer is amazing.
Actually, I'm kind of pumped.
Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
You just got okay.
- I'll do it.
- Yeah.
All right.
Well, Jared we gotta one day figure out what we're gonna do for you for a job.
Richard, you'll go.
You'll establish yourself, and when the time is right, you'll send for me.
Richard, you have to talk to this man.
Who, Barker? Pass.
This guy is real, okay, Richard? With his managerial skills and your talent as an engineer, we could be talking about the D-word here.
- Dick? - No.
Decacorn.
A company that's valued over $10 billion before its initial public offering.
All right? He's still at Raviga for another hour.
Please go talk to him.
Sorry, I can't do that.
I'm already set up at Flutterbeam.
Whose CEO, unprompted, said, "A brain like Richard's comes along once in a generation.
" Sorry.
I'm just proud.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Richard, I'm not asking you to spoon with the guy or even fork him.
- What I'm asking for - What is that? Forking is when you use your dick and your two legs to stab him in the lower torso.
I'm asking for you to take 10 minutes and talk to him before you throw everything that we built away.
And yes, I did say "we.
" I mean, if you want to stop by Raviga, it's on the way to Flutterbeam.
I mean, I threw some Tyson-level haymakers at this guy.
Richard, he didn't flinch.
He floats like a butterfly.
Hey, Richard.
What's going on? - We've been talking.
- Okay.
Guys, this isn't really a great time.
Richard.
We wanna tell you something.
Right? Yeah, it's something important.
Maybe later.
So, Richard? Guys, come on.
We know you're leaving - Yep.
Well aware.
- but - We're not.
Yeah.
- we're gonna stay at Pied Piper.
Really? Why are you laughing? I'm sorry.
Wow.
Well, it's just that you really think that you're gonna be able to scale the platform without me? Goddamn it! - Yeah.
- You don't think we can? Well, I know you can't.
That's a bold statement.
- Richard.
- We have massive tech debt.
You really think that you can scale and deploy my library without any input from me? Are you serious here? - Yes, we do.
- Yeah.
Then I guess you are truly delusional.
Well, I think you're an arrogant prick.
I'm the arrogant prick.
Okay.
This is coming from two people who think they know everything about code they didn't even write.
We wrote a lot of the code.
- You wrote some of it.
- You know what? We're gonna stay, and we're gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong.
Okay.
Thank you for the solidarity by the way, and sticking with your friend.
You know what, Erlich? You can tell Barker to go fuck himself, so I can go to Flutterbeam and then watch these two assholes crash and burn trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves.
This'll be great.
Great timing, guys.
Thank you so much.
Premium stuff, Dinesh.
Richard.
Richard? Well, we are now living in a post-Rigby world.
Man, this place is amazing.
Yeah.
We raised a shit ton of money.
We're growing fast as balls.
But we're not exactly super psyched with the quality of our engineering.
Well, it's a good thing I'm here then, right? Yeah.
All joking aside, I actually have a few thoughts on your video platform if you We're pretty happy with the basic platform.
We want to hand you something way cooler.
It's kind of like a secret project.
I got to warn you, though.
It's pretty rad.
Sit right here.
Okay.
- All right.
- Oh.
Hello.
This is the present.
You ready to go to the future? Sure.
Three, two, one.
Bam! Oh.
I I have a mustache.
Fuck yeah, you do.
And check this out.
Turn your head.
See that? Compositing perfect 3-D holographic mustaches using depth-sensing cameras in a live video chat.
And no one's doing it.
Nobody.
Sorry.
This is the this is the rad thing? Look, Richard, we agree, okay? We're not there yet.
We're using a crappy plug-in, so the latency is bad.
You turn too fast, that mustache is on your ear.
But with your help, we think we can cut our 'stache lag to just 20 milliseconds motion-to-photon in nine months? Just in time for Movember.
So, which one do you want on your employee badge? - Tom Selleck? - Aloha.
Ooh, Fu Manchu.
- John Waters.
- Not bad.
Alex Trebek.
Hitler.
- Probably not Hitler.
Skip him.
- Oh yeah.
- Bam.
Sam Elliot.
- Howdy.
Sure.
Oh.
Uh Okay, so we've got to hop on a call with biz dev Okay.
but feel free to keep on 'staching.
Okay? - There you go.
- All right.
Hey, if you want to have your attorney look over the employment agreement and the stock option grant, it's cool by us, all right? Just sign it.
You're in.
- We'll see you Monday, man.
- We're pumped.
Okay.
Well, your pumpedness makes me pumped.
Uh, uh Pete Monahan, please.
It's Richard Hendricks.
I just need him to go over a contract for me.
What? Are you an attorney here to see a client? No.
Actuallt, I'm a client who is here see my attorney.
Okay.
Follow me.
It began as a innocent celebration of our arbitration victory.
I ordered a kombucha, which I did not realize contained alcohol.
It was described to me as a healthy, organic tea.
Next thing I knew, I was 70 miles away, wrapped naked in a blanket, shaking off a meth high, and facing charges for attacking a police horse with a shovel.
Oh.
Holy shit.
From a legal standpoint, it was a clear violation of my parole, and I must now serve my entire sentence Okay.
and any additional time stemming from the new charges, which continue to accrue.
But I'm owning my mistakes.
- Oh.
- I am staying positive.
Enough about me.
Let's take a look at that contract.
Okay.
I would red-line it, but I'm not allowed to have a pencil.
Oh.
This makes less sense the more I look at it.
Okay.
What's this number over here? I don't know.
I didn't handle the compression library.
Neither did I.
You're telling me Richard did this all on his own? Shit.
I thought you did it.
Now I respect you even less.
We each know 90 percent of the platform but it's the same 90 percent.
Maybe that arrogant prick was right.
We can't scale it without him.
We are so fucked.
Wait.
- Yeah? - I got it.
We quit out of solidarity with Richard.
That's interesting.
So even though he said all that horrible shit to us, we take the high road and we get his back.
Yeah.
Maybe he'll even hire us at his new company.
Flutterbeam.
- Mustaches? - Yes.
Doesn't necessarily have to stop at people.
They can put mustaches on their pets, too.
It's actually pretty fun.
So, soon you'll be putting mustaches on cats and dogs and - snakes.
- Snakes, yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's a little tricky because they don't have a philtrum, so finding an anchor point for that mustache is actually gonna be quite of a technological challenge.
- It's exciting stuff.
- It really is.
Richard.
Let me ask you something.
Why are you leaving Pied Piper? They pushed me out.
I thought they offered you another position.
Yeah, CTO.
It's a demotion.
Well, wouldn't you be CTO at Flutterbeam? Yes, but at least this way, I don't have to eat shit.
Richard, let me tell you something I learned here on the inside.
Swallow your pride, or soon you'll be eating something far worse than shit.
Believe me.
Don't you think you should at least meet this Barker fellow? So where are we? Seventeen hundred people slated for exiting.
Their negated options total 780,000 shares.
That money can be allocated anyway you see fit.
Employee bonuses, renovations to the day-care center.
What have you.
What should we prioritize? Sorry, I don't understand.
It's all in the document.
You take that severance package, and you leave Hooli immediately.
But the most important aspect is the non-disclosure, non-disparagement clause, in which you agree not to say anything negative in the press, in public, or in private about Hooli or Gavin Belson.
Okay, I won't.
You will not discuss anything you did at Hooli at all, in perpetuity, throughout the universe.
I didn't really do anything at Hooli, so Good.
You're getting the hang of it already.
So, can I keep my Hooli ID, though, so I can still come and hang out with my friends on the roof? You cannot.
Officially, you will no longer have any friends here.
Shoot.
I have to think about this then.
This settlement offer is quite generous.
I know, I know.
I mean, $2 million is a lot of money.
Two? No.
It's It's $20 million.
Twenty? So they fired me before they hired you, so it's not your fault.
I just I feel like this can't really work.
- Do you understand? - I do, Richard.
It's like can I really be expected to do my best work when I am constantly feeling undervalued at the company that I started? Does that make sense? It does, Richard.
Absolutely.
I hear each and every one of your concerns loud and clear, and I appreciate your position.
Mm.
So, I guess we just won't do it.
Come on, I'll walk you out.
Wait.
What? Sorry.
You what? Jack? Sorry, I don't understand.
You're not gonna take the job? Not if you're not.
Without you handling the tech, I don't see how this company works.
Wow.
I mean, yeah, I agree.
Richard, it's hard enough running a business when everyone is on the same page.
And clearly, we are not.
- Well yeah.
- No, no, it's fine, and I appreciate you being so honest with me.
I mean, better we find out now, right? Yeah.
Anyway, I hope we each find a good fit somewhere.
Thanks for coming up.
You got a hell of a brain there, Richard Hendricks.
You drive safe.
Yeah.
Shit.


******************************************
N/A - Two in the Box
1 Well, Richard, according to all of your test results, you are what we in the medical field call healthy.
In fact, you've got kind of a glow about you.
- Oh, really? - Absolutely.
You know, if it were medically possible, I might even think that you were pregnant.
Of course, I thought my girlfriend was pregnant, and I was sure wrong about that.
(Laughs) Whoops! Hey, give me that ring back! Oh, what a mess.
What a mess that was.
So, been any big changes for you, diet or exercise? Well, I actually got fired as CEO of my company.
I'm working now as the CTO under the new CEO, Jack Barker.
Wait a minute.
You got a boss at your own company? Yeah, I know that sounds bad, but honestly, he handles all the budgeting, all the VC funding.
He just negotiated a great new lease on our new offices.
I don't know.
I think this could be great for me.
Boy, I don't think I could have another doctor coming in here, being my boss.
No.
It'd be like, "Hey, boss, "is it okay if I listen to his heart? "Can I do that? Oh, no? Sorry.
"No, I won't.
Okay.
- (laughing) Whatever you say!" - (chuckles) - Ah, funny.
- It is funny.
Yeah.
But listen, if it works for you, that's great.
Just one more thing.
I've gotta check your testicles.
Oh my God.
Okay.
What, for like a hernia or something? No.
I just wanna make sure they're still there.
(laughs) (theme music playing) Oh, wow.
This is going to be our office? All of this? Yeah, Jack said we have the whole floor.
Dinesh: Wow, look at that kitchen.
This is great.
Richard, is that our new logo? I like it.
It's clean and elegant, but not without some danger.
Jack: Gentlemen, welcome.
I moved away from the flute-playing guy.
I don't know if you guys realized it, but that was a little phallic.
I didn't want to waste your time with it, so I just pulled the trigger.
Mari Sheibley did this.
Oh.
Mari Sheibley.
That must've set you back a bit.
No.
She's a friend.
Yeah.
I know her as well.
Casually.
So, why don't I show you guys your new home? Hopefully, it lives up to your standards.
Gilfoyle: Yeah, compared to the shit shack we're used to, anything's an improvement.
Ah, an insult born of respect.
I'll worry when we start complimenting each other.
Fucking dick.
I assume you saw Hiroki putting in the water feature.
Good feng shui.
Gotta have that.
This is the engineering area.
Dinesh: We're gonna work here? That is a separate, professionally-catered micro-kitchen back there.
I want you hungry here, never here.
This is all great, but can we really afford all this? Hey, step into my office, Richard.
- Here.
- Okay.
I wanna show you something.
Dinesh: This is way better than Erlich's shithole.
Richard: "The Conjoined Triangles of Success"? I invented that, and now it's taught at business schools.
You see what's on the bottom here? The foundation of the whole thing.
- Growth? - Growth.
The more brilliant people we can get working here, then the faster we can get whatever is in your head out into the world.
Let me tell you a story.
In 1999, Google was a little startup, just like we are.
And when they started bringing in chefs and masseuses, we thought, "They're nuts!" But they were attracting the best possible people, and they were able to create the best product, and now they're worth over $400 billion.
And do you know the name of that company? Google, right? You said it at the beginning of the story.
You're right.
I did that wrong.
And the whole point is that all of this is a sound investment as long as we are able to get the best people and make the best possible product.
All right.
Winner gets the big monitor.
I understand how this works.
Both: Ready? Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.
Suck it.
I should've known you'd throw rock.
That's all you know in Pakistan.
It's in your blood.
Don't you guys call it "Rock, Rock, Rock"? That's funny.
You should type up all your racist jokes - on your tiny monitor.
- Is that monitor not big enough? You need a bigger monitor? You just put it on the list over there, and our purchasing guy will hook you up.
- Seriously? - Absolutely.
Hey, Jared, how about you? You need any new gear for the office? No, I'm BYOC.
Let me know if you need anything.
Richard, do you think it'd be okay if I took this box? I'm moving out of Noah's guest house after work.
And you want to sleep in that box? (laughs) No.
I haven't slept in a box in years.
Stop.
Now that Pied Piper's funded, I have enough money to move back into my condo.
Oh.
Congratulations.
I thought you sold it.
No, I've been AirBNB'ing it out to cover the mortgage.
But it'll be good to get home.
I've been missing my tub a lot, and Noah's been using a lot of hate speech with me lately, so moving will be a good thing.
All right, guys, think I'm gonna take off unless you need me to stick around, help you transition.
- I - By doing what? I could introduce you to some of the people that work here.
I made some major inroads with Hiroki.
- No.
- Why would we want that? Fair yeah, fair point.
So, welcome to your new home.
Enjoy it, guys.
I gave you this.
Oh.
Sorry.
Sorry.
How was everyone's morning? - Uh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
Let me tell you about mine.
I started my day, as I always do, by typing my own name into Hooli-Search.
I enjoy the ritual, which is designed to center me.
But lately, it's been doing the opposite.
Whose work station is this? Observe.
(keyboard clicks) These are all remnants of a time before I wrote Nucleus down.
Why are we allowing our own technology to dredge up our painful past? Why is it that when I type my own name into my own company search engine, the fucking Internet rains shit-bolts down on me? I want this to stop! These articles are part of the public record.
Your point? Are you suggesting that we alter the fundamental neutrality of the Hooli-Search algorithm? That's a clear violation of the public trust.
Yelp is threatening to sue Google for this very thing.
I can't, in good conscience, order Hooli-Search engineers to do that.
I never suggested anything of the sort.
No Hooli-Search engineer will ever be asked to alter the neutrality of the algorithm.
Patrice: And so, Gavin doesn't want to see any more negative mentions of Nucleus on Hooli-Search.
So we're gonna alter the search algorithm? Of course not.
That would be unethical.
What are we supposed to do? Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news? Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is? Don't you swear at me.
We don't work here anymore.
For 10 more days you do! Unless you'd all like to quit and walk away from your entire severance packages! Amazing.
(whistling) Whoa, whoa! Oh.
- Jared.
Whoa.
- (laughs) What's up? Hi.
Umm I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.
You you were supposed to be out on Tuesday.
Oh, I was, but plans have changed.
See I can't really afford to move or pay rent, so I'm gonna have to stay a little while.
Okay, look I appreciate your situation, but you're breaking the terms of our contract.
Listen, I don't want to be a dick, it's just I can't afford to live around here.
'cause the rent is so high, because of the tech companies, right? And you bought this place with the money you made working at the tech companies, so it kind of all evens out, right? That that makes no sense.
I know.
Right? Okay, look, I can give you a few days, two weeks tops, but if you're not out by then, I'm gonna have to take legal action.
This bums me out, man.
I thought you were like the one cool tech guy.
Me? Are you sure? Not anymore.
- - Well Well, the occupant of a residence in California has almost unlimited rights.
I have to get his permission to enter my property.
I can't turn off the power or the gas, and I have to hire a lawyer to start a legal eviction.
That won't be cheap.
Jeez, man.
I'm sorry.
That sucks.
So, where did you sleep last night? I did not.
How was your sleep? It was it was good, yeah.
I mean, I slept like a stone.
It's odd not having to do everything ourselves, isn't it? Yeah, I'm I'm kinda loving it.
Hey, you ready to go to work? Chef Amy asked us what we wanted for breakfast, and I said, "Surprise us.
" Could be anything.
Let's go! When was the last time you saw those two - go anywhere before noon? - Indeed.
Well, let's go get some gluten-free waffles.
Oh.
Sorry about the surprise.
- I don't care.
- I asked Chef Amy to tell me.
I have too many dietary restrictions to leave breakfast to chance.
- Makes sense.
- Ah, two of my incubees off to eat the world.
Be well, work hard, and know one another.
(chuckles) Okay.
I recently helped them install a new CEO at Pied Piper.
I needed to take a more hands-off approach, focus on the future incubees, like yourself, with great ideas, like cataloging malware.
Sexy.
Uh, would you care for another coconut water? They are the most expensive unpasteurized variety, if that's any concern.
Actually, my concern is the room.
It's kind of a dump.
Oh, sure, now.
But with a new coat of paint, you'll hardly recognize the place when you move in next month.
Actually shit's pivoted.
I need a place next week.
Next week? Oh, shit has pivoted.
Well, I'll talk to the current tenant.
Let him know that the time has come.
Mother fuck.
Yeah, put him on a slow boat to China, so to speak.
I'm sorry.
It just slipped out.
I'll ask Chef Amy to make you something else.
- No, no, no, I want waffles.
- (people murmuring) I just wanted them to be a surprise, Jared.
I wanted surprise waffles.
Gilfoyle: Who are these people? Uh, I don't know.
Did Jack hire engineers already? These people are not in the engineering gene pool.
That's right, fellas.
These are our new sales people.
They're the best in the business.
Sales? Uh, Jack? Jack? Shouldn't we hire engineers to build the platform before we get people to sell it? No.
God, no! The system, Richard.
Sales and engineering are the two pillars of the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
Yeah.
Engineering and sales must work together to decide what to build.
Who knows better what the customers need than the people who actually deal with the customers every single day? We're all gonna meet at 1:00, Richard.
You're gonna love these guys.
They're the best.
So, while the Hooli lawsuit did hamper our ability to get funding, it did not slow down the engineering.
Yes, question? Yeah, Keith, Northeast Regional.
So, you don't foresee any technical debt issues slowing our ability to scale? Actually, no, none whatsoever.
We've identified all our underlying issues, and we have a plan in place for rapid growth.
Uh, yes? Don, Global Accounts and Systems Integration.
What kind of growth are you projecting here? Well, this may sound a little bit grandiose, but it's not unrealistic to think that we have the potential for worldwide penetration on the scale of, say, Google or Facebook.
This is really great, Richard.
Just keep going.
Sure.
Yeah.
Well, in regards to the launch, we are hoping to go wide, get it into the hands of as many people as possible.
Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
- They call me "Jan the Man.
" - Oh.
When you say "people," you mean "companies," right? - Yeah, we're business-facing.
- Okay, just wanted to clarify.
Actually, no.
No, sorry, Jan the Man.
By "people," I do mean "people.
" Humans.
Consumers.
Uh, Keith, Northeast Regional, again.
Jack told us we would be selling directly to businesses.
- He did? - Doug.
I'm shadowing Keith.
- Yes, he did.
- Definitely.
I was there.
Don, again.
Well, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, because the plan has always been entirely based on the freemium model, like Dropbox? You know, you give the platform away free to consumers, and then once you have a big enough user base, then you sell premium services to businesses.
If we're giving it away now and waiting until later to sell it, what are we doing here now? I don't know.
I don't know.
We could maybe ask Jack when he gets back from wherever Sorry, one second.
Just just one moment.
Jack.
Sorry, Jack.
Sorry.
Excuse me, Jack.
Are you leaving? Oh, I have this charity wine thing.
Sorry, I committed to it months ago, but you are killing it in there, Richard.
Uh, well, actually no.
Sorry.
They just said that you told them that we would be business-facing? Ah, they filled you in.
That's good.
I was under the impression that we would be consumer first.
My guys are pretty set on that.
Richard, I read your deck, and you projected it'll be four years until we get to revenue? Uh, yeah.
You know we're in a bubble right now, right? Or maybe you don't know.
You weren't around for the last bubble.
You were probably in diapers.
- I was 11.
- Well, I wasn't in diapers.
I don't I wasn't either.
I was there.
And in March of 2000, do you know when a four-year plan ended? April of 2000.
We gotta move, now.
We can't put all of our eggs in the pot-of-gold-at-the-end- of-the-rainbow basket.
So, the the pot of gold is in the basket? Richard, these are the best salespeople in the world, and when they tell me that business-facing is the play, I gotta listen to that, okay? - That's fair, but it's - I'm just asking you to talk to your guys about modifying your platform for enterprise.
I mean, just just see how it feels, okay? And no matter what happens, I promise you this: I will never compromise the product.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine, I will talk to my guys, but they're not gonna be happy about it.
No, of course not.
They're engineers.
I'll see you later.
I realize this is a Japanese tradition and that you are Chinese.
I'm not racist.
Yes, Japanese people racist.
- They are horrible.
- No.
No, no.
Jian-Yang, in every relationship, there are ebbs and flows.
- Ebbs? - Yes.
And although we have flowed, our relationship now has come to a permanent ebbing.
- Flow.
- No.
No.
We have come to a permanent ebb.
Do you understand? So, you want me to leave the house? Yes.
Yes.
Very much so.
And so, I thank you for our today.
Now you bow.
Bow.
All the way to the waist.
N-no.
- Okay.
- Thank you, Elrich.
Goodbye, little one.
I'm gonna miss you.
Can't say it wasn't fun, Jian-Yang you little Cantonese bastard.
(garbage disposal grinding) - Hey, you like this? - What are you doing? Hi, my name's Erlich Bachman.
I'm a lying fuck! Who who are you yelling at? We're the only two people in the fucking house! Erlich a liar! You're not gonna get me to change my opinion about myself.
Liar! Take that outta there! I don't know, Richard.
I don't think it's that big a deal.
Really, you don't? You're okay with being business first? Granted, it's not what we would do if we were in charge, but Jack seems to know what he's doing.
This is fucking amazing.
I feel like I'm in "Minority Report.
" And in reality, you're just a minority.
Richard, relax.
We're still building the neural net.
We still get to do all the cool stuff, right? Yeah, of course.
We're not scrapping any peer-to-peer delivery? No, no, definitely not.
So, we're still doing the same stuff, just in a different order.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, the eviction process is officially underway, but my attorney says it may take up to a year.
- Where are you gonna stay? - Well, I always have my trick.
All right, I'll bite.
What's your trick? I simply imagine that my skeleton is me, and my body is my house, and that way, I'm always home.
Okay.
Well we are now business-facing.
I don't know if you heard.
That means we have to rewrite our entire deck.
I just hope it doesn't put us way the fuck behind.
Behind who? EndFrame sucks and Nucleus shit the bed, remember? Yeah, yeah.
You're right, you're right.
(chimes) Wow.
(sighs) This is endless.
If we worked this hard on Nucleus in the first place, we probably wouldn't be scrubbing it right now.
- Dude, are you done? - Yup.
How'd you script digest all those strings so fast? I don't know.
It's just a predictive loop.
Actually, it's sort of like a context tree.
Holy shit.
What's up? Hey, Jared, why don't we knock off for tonight? Just pick this back up tomorrow morning? Mmm.
Agreed.
I'm going on close to 40 hours without good sleep, and the edges of things are starting to get a little dancey.
What? Erlich, thank you again for allowing me to occupy a corner of your cozy garage.
It is my hearth and my home.
- What the fuck? - (yells) Jian-Yang, Jesus Christ, don't sneak up on people like that, you devious little bastard, especially if they're cleaning glassware.
You kick me out, but you let him stay.
He's not even an incubee.
No, he's not, and he's not staying in the house.
He's in the garage, like a sad bag of potting soil.
Have some compassion.
I mean, the guy rented his place to some fuckhead tenant who won't leave.
Jared is fucked, Jian-Yang.
He can go to the police.
It's useless.
California law gives landlords literally no recourse.
So, he can go to court.
Of course, he's going to go to court, you four-eyed turd.
But in America, the legal system doesn't work very well, so it will take at least a year for the proceedings to even begin.
Do you understand that? Yes.
I stay here for one year.
I pay no rent.
You have no recourse.
That's not always the case.
I mean, sometimes court systems can move faster, - especially if you have money for - I'm going to smoke in my room.
- Oh.
Mother fuck.
- Special occasion.
If we stack that same loop on top of the bit-level encoder that we took from Hendricks, and then we tethered it to the routine we were trying to use That would be a huge jump in speed.
This is mega.
This is what Hendricks did at Tech Crunch Disrupt.
I think we just cracked middle-out.
We should probably tell Gavin, right? Why? He fired us.
You know how much we could get paid if we took this somewhere else? - (phone cameras clicking) - Fuck off.
Okay, let me get this straight.
First you talked me into going business-facing, and now you want to eliminate the entire neural net from the platform? Jan, Director, Inside Sales.
They call me "Jan the Man.
" Yes, we know, "Jan the Man.
" Listen, we have to do neural net for deep learning.
Look, once we get enough data flowing through the system, it will be able to recognize long-range patterns and actually learn.
It will be able to optimize our algorithm on its own, increasing our already superior speed and efficiency.
Right? Pretty cool, huh? But it won't be able to do that if we delete it.
- Do you get that? - But you just said it.
It requires a central repository of data, right? Businesses want to protect their data.
They're huge pussies when it comes to security.
Okay, well, we're not cutting machine learning.
We're not.
If we cut that, we might as well cut peer-to-peer delivery, and all the efficiencies of the cloud.
Are those still in? No, those have to go also.
- What? - Keith, by the way.
I know your name, okay? I know everybody's name.
Look (chuckles) we can't cut everything about this platform that makes it revolutionary just because that's a little harder for you guys to sell, all right? If we want to sell out, let's just sell all the way out.
Let's just take the algorithm, jam it into a metal fucking box, stick it in the back of a data center somewhere, so it can't connect to anything, and it just sits there and no one even knows it's there.
Doug, still shadowing Keith.
When you say "metal box," you're talking about a rack-mounted server-type appliance? No, no, no.
I am using it as a rhetorical example of a bad idea.
That's fucking stupid.
Oh my God.
I just need to find Jack.
One second.
- Where's Jack? - He had to go meet his vet.
His vet? In the middle of the day? Okay, well, what's the vet's address? Jack, excuse me.
Do you mind telling me Holy shit.
What is that? - Oh, mother of God.
- Richard, what are you doing here? What do you mean? It's 2:30.
What are you doing here? My number one breeding mare went into heat.
Sorry, she's not much for schedules.
Oh God.
Thoroughbreds, Richard.
Natural cover only.
Now, you don't see that very often, do you? Nope.
Uh I had a meeting I had a meeting with the sales guys and Jan the Man (stammers) You know what? Can we talk over here? This is just hard for me.
(horse grunting) Look, Jack, you and I have a problem.
Okay, your salespeople are telling me to cut everything cool about the platform just because it's a little bit harder for them to sell.
But don't you think because they are such amazing salespeople that it would be okay for them to sell the harder stuff? No.
It doesn't work that way.
The way you keep the best salespeople is, you need to give 'em something easy to sell.
(scoffs) Otherwise, they'd just go somewhere else.
Okay, well, Pied Piper could honestly be the global standard for file compression and storage.
Every mobile device on the face of the planet could be able to access their data as if they had a fiber optic cable plugged into it.
People in the desert, people in refugee camps, people who have nothing could suddenly have access to everything.
You know, everybody in this industry, they say they want to make this world a better place, but we could actually do it.
We could do it and make billions of dollars.
- Richard, listen - No, you listen to me, Jack.
You promised me that you would never compromise the product.
So, do you feel like taking some action and backing me up on this, because me and my product feel pretty fucking compromised right now.
Richard, I don't think you understand what the product is.
The product isn't the platform, and the product isn't your algorithm, either.
And it's not even the software.
Do you know what Pied Piper's product is, Richard? Is Is it me? Oh God! No! No.
How could it possibly be you? You got fired.
Pied Piper's product is its stock.
Its stock? And whatever makes the value of that stock go up, that is what we are going to make.
And maybe sometime in the future, we could change the world and perform miracles, and all of that stuff, and I hope we do.
But, like I told you before, I'm not going to mortgage the present for that.
I need to move the needle today.
And now, if you will excuse me.
I paid $150,000 for the semen that's about to come out of that stallion, and I would very much like to be there to see that it happens.
- (cell phone chimes) - (horse neighing) Oh! Hey, Richard! Yes? I just got a text from Keith, Northeast Regional.
He says the guys love your idea.
What idea? - - Announcer: It's a big world, but thanks to modern technology, it's smaller than ever.
Today, business moves at the speed of light.
You can access your company's data anywhere, anytime.
But if you can get your data, who else can get it? Spies, thieves, criminals, and foreigners.
What if there was a way to take all of your company's data and back it up in a protected enclosure completely isolated from the world at large? Oh no.
The ultimate enterprise data storage solution.
Now that's what I'm talking about.
This is the game we're playing, team, so let's win it! You guys, check it out.
Chef Amy hollowed out a watermelon and filled it with watermelon jello! Look, that's actual rind.
- The fuck is that? - Is that a VCR? Why does it say "Pied Piper" on it? Why is everybody so happy? (reggae music playing) Everyday Things are getting worse Everyday Things are getting worse Time so hard Dog and all a look work Time so hard Dog and all a look work Everyday Things are getting worse Everyday Things are getting worse I took him down to the market place And them laugh at my dog You never see Smoke without fire, oh! You gotta hold your head up higher Everyday Things are getting worse Everyday Things are getting worse Time so

N/A - Meinertzhagen's Haversack

1 Here it is.
This is your future.
One of your Pied Piper boxes would go right here in this rack.
Okay.
(SIGHS) MAN: Okay.
Let me show you the next location in which we would install one of your boxes.
GILFOYLE: Richard.
What the fuck are we doing here? I don't like it any more than you do.
I told Jack we'd come check this place out and then we'd have a discussion.
DINESH: I can't believe you suggested the idea of building a fucking appliance.
I didn't, okay? I pitched it as an example of what not to do and the fucking sales guys ran with it.
I didn't want to go to enterprise.
You were the ones who said it would be fine.
- No, we didn't say that.
- You said it all the time.
That's not what we said.
That is not Here it is.
This is where another one of your Pied Piper boxes would go.
Okay.
Good.
Okay.
Let me show you the next location - in which we would install - Actually, you know what? Sorry.
No offense, but once you see one space in a rack, you've kind of seen them all.
That's what I used to think until I saw them all.
Would you like to see your desks? - Our desks? - What? This is where we would install a Pied Piper engineer.
Sorry.
Why, exactly, would we need to be here? Your sales representative promised 24-hour-a-day, on-site maintenance at least for the first year.
So, one of us would have to be down here for a year? Even at night? There's really no difference between day and night down here, so it makes things easy.
Okay, well, we should probably get going.
Now.
- Almost right now.
- Yeah, right now even.
Okay.
There are 16 stairwells.
Which one would you like to see first? Just whatever's as fast as possible.
- Your favorite one.
- Hmm.
Okay.
- Oh! - You see these fucking mole people? Hey, where did John go? GILFOYLE: Oh shit.
Did he go in a room? No.
Uh probably around here.
(LOUDLY) Hey, John? - John? - Oh.
Uh John? - John! - Oh shit.
GILFOYLE: John! - DINESH: Where is he? John! - John! (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) We can't take my algorithm and put it in a box and bury it at Maleant.
- We just can't.
- I think this thing is dead.
Jack, look, I have no doubt that your guys can sell a box and an appliance may be a good short-term play, but in the long term, we need to be building - our full-time platform.
- Gloria! Could you call the fish guy and see what kind of warranty we have one these things? I think one of them is dead.
(SIGHS) Jack, please.
You said that when we got back from Maleant - we would discuss this.
- Okay, let's discuss it.
Take a look at the Conjoined Triangles of Success.
Now, what do those two triangles make together? - A square? - A box.
They make a box.
- You can't make that shit up.
- But you literally did make it up.
Yes, I did.
And now they teach it at business schools.
But I was only referring to the serendipity of the coincidence.
Look, if we build you the box, will you promise to let us build the platform when it's done? We'll think about then then.
Now we need to worry about now.
Build me a box now.
How'd it go? Uh, not well.
All right, then.
What do you What do you mean? What are you doing? Well, first, I'm changing my Linkedln status to "Looking for work.
" That box is artless commerce.
I won't be a party to it.
So, you're just gonna quit? Just like that? How How can you do that? By saying the words "I" and "quit" in conjunction together i.
e.
, I quit.
Well, there's actually some paperwork involved.
Hey, can I have that USB missile launcher? I'll just fish it out of the trash later.
RICHARD: Gilfoyle, come on.
Give me some time to figure a way out of this, 'cause if you quit now, you're gonna lose all your shares.
And what if Barker changes his mind and lets us build the platform? And the odds of that are? - (CELL PHONE BEEPS) - Oh.
Already? Recruiters move fast these days.
This is Gilfoyle.
Dazzle me.
More recruiter swag? You got an Oculus? - Yup.
- That's a hoverboard? How many meetings are you taking? None.
That's the irony.
The more meetings I turn down, the more these recruiters send me.
- What are you doing? - Eating popcorn.
- That's my popcorn.
- You have seven tubs of it.
You could be the mayor of Popcornopolis.
Don't eat the caramel.
You can have the cheese or the plain.
- You're leaving me with the cheddar? - That's right.
Dick.
Hey, can I borrow this? Just for a little bit? No.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
You're wearing a gold chain? Oh, right.
Yeah, I've had it for a while.
Just kind of throw it on every now and then.
None of that is true.
- I definitely would've noticed.
- Okay, listen.
I've been working hard.
I'm making money for the first time.
I was like buy myself something nice, you know? But instead of that, you bought a chain? You're just jealous I have a salary, quitter.
And you are too legit to quit, eh, MC Hamas? - Fuck off.
- Later, Chain the Virgin.
Well, Gilfoyle, looks like your recruiters are gonna have to take back their gift baskets, because I just got off the phone with Monica and she's getting me in to see Laurie this morning so I can tell her what's going on.
But you're you're going over your CEO's head? That is a serious breach of protocol.
I mean, if Jack finds out, he'll be furious.
Hey, when you push a man so far, he goes out, buys a gun, and shoots everyone in a bank.
- Whoa.
- No, I wouldn't, I wouldn't.
I'm not I'm not going to.
Just The point is, what other option do I have, anyway? What other option do you have, Richard? Can I speak with you alone, please? Hmm? Are you angry with me, Richard? Have I done something to offend you? No.
What are you talking about? You know, when you and the boys picked up and went to the new offices, and didn't invite me along I didn't say anything.
Yeah, because you don't work at Pied Piper.
And you haven't let me forget that for even one moment, have you, Richard? I-I-I I'm having trouble tracking this.
I don't know what you're mad about.
You publicly proclaimed, "I have to go over Barker's head because what other option do I have?" What other option do you have, Richard? - Uh - 'Cause there is another option, and he's standing here, looking you in the face, and you're staring back like he don't even exist.
Just to be as clear as I possibly can be here, are you trying to tell me that you want to talk to Barker? No, Richard, I don't want to talk to Barker.
I want you to want me to talk to Barker.
You know at this point, if it'll make you feel better, sure, you can go talk to Barker.
See? Was that so hard? Actually, yes, that was painfully difficult.
Yeah, she's definitely dead.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Gloria! Gloria! Gl Oh! Would you take this daughter of Neptune back from whence she came? The toilet, dear.
That's okay.
What can I do for you, Mr.
Bachman? Ah yes, to the matter at hand.
I spoke with Richard about the box project, and Well, here are some of my thoughts in no particular order.
- Why a box? - What information do I not already have? I'm sorry? I said, "What information do I not already have?" I already have a five-year run rate plus a full market forecast for my appliance.
I have the same for Richard's platform.
I've heard all of his engineering team's complaints.
So, before you waste time with some freeform jazz odyssey of masturbatory bullshit, just tell me what concrete information you have for me that I do not already possess! Richard.
(SIGHS) The way I see it, you've got about two options.
One, you build yourself the box.
Two, you get Laurie Bream on the phone ASAP.
All right, I'll see you back at the house.
Okay.
Ah.
Hiroki-san.
(SPEAKS JAPANESE) Umm What is that one? It is a question mark made of human hair, harvested, apparently, from dead people in India.
It's a pun.
It signifies that at Raviga, we ask the big, hairy questions.
Right.
Speaking of questions What should we do about Jack? Well, I concur with your assessment that a backup appliance for data centers seems an uninspired application of your technology.
I will contact him and we'll have a frank discussion about this.
Great.
I really appreciate you hearing me out on this.
And it goes without saying, I was never here.
Oh? What? You are here.
Now.
What Richard means is he would prefer if you didn't tell Jack that he came here to talk to you about this.
Yes, because the other interpretation makes no sense.
- - (PHONE RINGS) Jack, Laurie Bream on line one.
(WHISPERING) Guys.
Guys, it's happening.
It's happening.
Hello.
Okay.
Drop the hammer, Laurie Bream.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) What are you doing? He's going to see you looking.
I can't see 'cause of these fucking monitors.
- Whose fucking fault is that, okay? - It's not my Shh! Something's happening.
What? What's happening? What's happening? Oh, man.
Barker's pissed.
How pissed? Scale of one to 10.
- Oh my God.
Seven.
- Fuck.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Like a nine, nine and a half.
DINESH: Fuck! I'm missing everything.
I'm going to go to the kitchen.
He doesn't know.
I could be hungry.
(SLAMS) It's over.
It's over.
I missed the whole fucking thing because of these fucking monitors.
Richard? Jack would like to see you in his office.
Oh.
Okay.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen, I'm gonna go ask Action Jack how Laurie's dick tastes.
- D No.
- Yeah.
You wanted to see me, chief? Sure, come on in, Richard.
Grab a seat.
RICHARD: Sure.
- (CLICKS) - (WHIRS) Oh.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
Okay.
So, guess who I just got off the phone with.
Uh I have no idea.
Who? - Laurie Bream.
- Laurie Bream.
From Raviga? Exactly.
She was pretty adamant that the whole box project here at Pied Piper was (SIGHS) woefully misguided.
Whoa.
Strong words.
Wow.
In fact, it was her opinion that we should immediately abandon the box in favor of the consumer platform version of Pied Piper which I believe you and your guys were bucking for.
Oh, I don't know about "bucking," but yeah.
Yeah, well, hey, look, - Laurie Bream is the investor.
- Yeah.
She is the investor.
Anyway, she wanted a comprehensive, go-to-market strategy for the platform version within 48 hours.
Wow.
Well, what Laurie wants, Laurie gets.
So yeah.
We should probably get started on that.
No, we shouldn't, Richard.
We're not building the platform.
We're building a box.
(SCOFFS) Okay, but didn't Laurie say that she wanted the platform? Yes, she said that, and then I said that if Pied Piper was going to build a platform, she would have to fire me.
Uh, what did she say? She said she was not interested in doing that at this time.
And did she say anything after that? We're building the box, Richard.
Twelve weeks from today, we're going to present her a prototype of that box.
So, let's get it done.
- (CLICKS) - (WHIRS) Okay.
Yup.
- (CLICKS) - (WHIRS) One more thing, Richard.
If you're going to shoot the king, you better be goddamn sure you kill him.
You understand what that means? (HESITANTLY) Yeah-ar.
Did you just say "Yar"? No.
Look at us.
Two rogues on the King's Highway.
Let the rats run in their maze.
We chose this.
This is our destiny.
- Freedom.
Isn't that right, Gilfoyle? - (LIGHTER FLICKS) - Did you say something? - Of course.
(KNOCK ON DOOR) If it's more popcorn, tell 'em we're at capacity.
It's a guy from "Men in Black.
" - Bertram Gilfoyle? - Yeah.
I'm here on behalf of Twen-X recruiting, - I'm supposed to give you this.
- Pappy Van Winkle.
Now we're talking.
I'll take it.
They told me not to give it to you until after the meeting.
I respect your skills.
Let me get my jacket.
She was supposed to talk Barker out of making the box.
What the fuck happened? - Richard.
- What? I was on the call, okay? She tried, he said no.
- Well, then she should fire him.
- She can't fire him.
Why not? She fired me.
Exactly.
She can't fire him because she fired you.
Firing a young CEO and installing a much more experienced one looks like leadership.
Firing two CEOs in a month looks like chaos.
Richard, look, I'm sorry, but I think the box is here to stay.
Okay? Laurie's gonna have to pretend to be in favor of it.
She'll probably issue press releases talking about how it's the best application of your visionary technology.
Is there nothing that we can say to Laurie to change her mind? If I could control Laurie, do you really think I'd be looking out my office door at that monstrosity? Jeez, Monica, he's not that bad.
I mean, he's a little ugly, I guess.
Oh, the question mark.
Sorry.
Mr.
Gilfoyle.
We're ready for you.
The guys cannot wait to see you again.
Again? - MARC: Gilfoyle.
- What the fuck? Good to see you again, buddy.
Why don't you have a seat? You stole half of our algorithm.
You think you can bring me in here and pay me to give you the rest? Oh.
No.
We want you because you're a full-stack engineer.
We already paid someone else for the missing piece of middle-out.
- Bullshit.
- Do you know Naveen and Eric, who, until very recently, headed up engineering at Nucleus? - Hey, man.
- What's up? - Nope.
- Well, I'm sure you at least recognize the code they brought us.
That's exactly how they had it.
Okay.
So, Endframe has our entire prediction loop, down to the last fucking semicolon.
So, Nucleus stole half our IP, and Endframe stole the other half.
And now they've knitted them together.
So, while we are busy building Barker's box, Endframe is beating us to market with a platform.
So, basically, we are a fucking mediocre appliance company.
At least we'll make a little money doing it.
Oh, great.
So, you can go back to the car wash and buy some more chains.
Huh, Pakistani Mr.
T? Fuck you.
Wait.
Are you not wearing it? You're not.
Did you take it off - because I was fucking with you? - DINESH: No.
It was itchy on my neck, so Bullshit.
That was a bad decision.
You flinched.
Now the pain will never end.
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry to say it, but Gilfoyle's right.
You're making it worse.
Sorry, Django.
Django? (LAUGHS) Unchained.
Great.
Now even fucking Jared is busting my balls.
I am.
I'm I'm busting your balls.
DINESH: You know what? If you're gonna give me shit for it anyway, I'm just going to wear it.
RICHARD: Okay, Jared.
Congratulations, by the way, but we have our own balls to worry about, all right? Look, how are we going to save the platform? What choice do we have? Barker is the CEO.
We have to do what he says.
Or do we? I don't know.
I don't want to lie down for this, okay? I don't want to just give up so easily.
Richard, unfortunately, in this case I think we have to roll over and take it.
(LOUDLY) Or do we? - Erlich, you have something to say? - Richard when George Washington founded a little startup we've come to know as these United States of America, and he was tired of getting shit from his CEO, the King of England, did he just roll over and take it from behind? No.
He called on his ride-or-die homeboys, Tommy Jefferson, Benny Franklin, and Alex Hamilton who was half-black, so that's Dinesh.
I'm not half-black.
He said, "Avast, ye fellow badasses, let's build this country the way we motherfucking want to.
" And so, Richard, if we want to build the platform, all we need to do is build the platform.
That was underwhelming.
Perhaps you can go into slightly more detail? We tell Barker exactly what he wants to hear.
That way, he thinks we're being good little boys.
But what we're actually doing is building the platform.
Think about it.
What's he gonna do? - Call the cops.
- Actually, no.
Erlich may be onto something.
If all we gave him was the platform, Jack would have no other option than to embrace it and say it was his idea all along, because at that point, he can't tell Laurie the truth.
What? That he had absolutely no idea what was going on inside of his own company? He'd look like an idiot.
And Laurie wants the platform, anyway, so she'd be good for it.
(SNAPPING FINGERS) Okay.
We build a skunkworks.
A secret company inside the company.
We go all "Ocean's Eleven" on his ass.
Hold on.
"Ocean's Eleven"? It's a 2001 casino heist film, starring Julia Roberts and 11 men.
I know what it is, Jared.
I'm saying not only are we going to have to engineer, code, and stand up a full platform on our own, we also have to make Jack and his sales weasels think we're working on the box the entire time.
And if we fuck anything up and get caught, he could take our stock and probably have us arrested.
- All right, I'm in.
- Well, you're insane.
No, Dinesh, that chain is insane.
And not in the membrane.
Sorry, Cypress Halal.
- (LAUGHS) - RICHARD: Okay, Jared, settle down.
But this? This is fucking genius.
Okay, how do we even begin to pull it off? Okay.
Well, let's work through it.
- - I can generate fake status reports, purchase orders, deliverables updates, and I can liaise with sales to coordinate what custom features we need to pretend to build.
RICHARD: Okay, great, yeah, but faking the box is going to be the easy part.
Building the platform is the real challenge.
Gilfoyle, where are we on the server space? That's gonna be tricky.
When we started moving out of the house, I dismantled Anton.
All the racks, GPUs, and cables are in storage at the office.
- We're gonna have to break him out.
- That's a shit-ton of hardware.
Unless we do it one piece at a time, like "Shawshank Redemption" or "The Great Escape," you know? I'd have bigger clothing on the day, but - Wait.
- Wait.
I've got a better idea.
Let's say these Legos are Anton, sad stacks of server components lying dormant in storage.
Sneaking all of him out would be too difficult.
So, if we can't break Anton out, maybe we can break in.
RICHARD: Stand the servers up right where they are.
- Can we do that? - Easy.
I can run cable through the drop panel in the ceiling all the way to the building's main power panel.
When I pull a little bit of power from each of the other tenants, no one will know.
Guys, I hate to keep shitting on your campfire, but servers are not the real issue.
We have a manpower problem.
There's a ton of engineering to be done on the platform.
Yeah, he's right, but we have to pay them under the table.
I know just the right man for the job.
You guys are fucking nuts, but I dig it.
Here's the deal.
I'm going to need the back pay you guys owe me for when I was working for free, not to mention lost wages from my old job.
Oh, and damages from when Jared sexually harassed me into being friends with that Monica chick.
So all that and you're in? In? No.
That's just to keep me from telling Barker about your secret project.
What? Are you serious? Oh yeah.
Well, there goes most of our cash.
DINESH: We just got extorted for $20,000.
Fuck Carla.
She was dead weight, anyway.
- What's next? - GILFOYLE: I just thought of something.
It's a big problem, but I think I've got a solution.
Hello, this is Bertram Gilfoyle.
Yes, I'm still available, and I would reconsider sitting down with you and your clients if you send four large pizzas to 5230 Newell Road in 30 minutes or less.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (SHOUTS) Okay.
I think that covers it.
We've thought of everything.
We have a plan.
- Everybody in? - In.
- In.
- Fuck yes, I'm in.
And I'm in to the idea of taking a bigger leadership role in the company.
We're not gonna make the same mistakes Okay, Erlich, just just say, "In.
" - We're all just saying, "In.
" - I'm in volved.
Hey, you can't spell "involved" without an "in.
" Just be in.
Uh, Dinesh? All right, fuck it, I'm in but on one condition.
I'm going to need everyone to solemnly swear, that they will no longer make fun of my gold chain.
Not a word ever again.
Well, guys, I think we can agree to that.
(SIGHS DEEPLY) This plan better fucking work with a sacrifice like this.
Shall we drink from the teat of Pappy to celebrate? I think I might actually enjoy going to work now.
Wait.
We can't enjoy going to work.
Meinertzhagen's haversack.
- What? - Meinertzhagen's haversack.
No one? Really? No one's heard of Meinertzhagen's haversack? Of course I have, Jared.
Just explain it to them.
Well, it's a principle of military deception.
Essentially, it means you have to continue to act the part.
So, as far as anyone knows, we're still building a box that we hate.
We need to act like it.
That's exactly right.
If we do anything differently, Barker's going to be onto us.
We have to keep complaining about Barker.
We have to keep bitching about the box.
We have to keep making fun of your gold chain.
We have to.
We don't have any other choice, Dinesh.
- He's right.
- It's a shame, Bell Biv Dinesh, but unfortunately, that chain is poison.
All right.
To skunkworks! - Hey, all right.
- I don't usually drink at 7:30 in the morning, but (LAUGHS) All right.
Hey, guys, look, we have to shred everything in this house - that pertains to skunkworks.
- If anyone catches wind of anything that we've done here, we are fucked.
Okay, you guys, this is it.
No turning back now.
Dinesh, I have a few premium chain insults that I'm going to lay on you when we get in there.
Not for myself, obviously, but for the team.
I just might have one too.
Sorry in advance.
Yeah.
Great.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Have at it, assholes.
- My smoke thick, my jewels gold - (ECHOING) My shoes new, these hoes chose My pistol work, my looks kill Bitch text me, her rent here Fuck with me, you know I got it Fuck with me, you know I got it Sexy bitch, I hope Hey, Dinesh, nice chain.
Do you choke your mother with it when you put your penis in her butthole? What the fuck? Oh shit! Oh.
Richard.
Here, I've got it.
No, no, no, that's private.
Excuse me.
Skunkworks? Private information.
Uh, Keith, where are you going? (WHISPERS) Richard, why did you bring all the skunkwork docs into the office? You were supposed to shred those.
Yes, but I was gonna shred them here, because we don't have a shredder at the house, do we? Guys? My office.
Now.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) That girl is poison Never trust a big butt and smile - That girl is poison - Poison If I were you, I'd take precaution Before I start to leave fly girl You know, 'cause in some portions You'll think she's the best thing in the world She's so fly She'll drive you right out of your mind And steal your heart when you're blind Beware she's schemin' She'll make you think you're dreamin' You'll fall in love And you'll be screamin', demon - Hoo - Poison, deadly, movin' slow Lookin' for a mellow fellow like DeVoe Gettin' paid, laid, so better lay low Schemin' on house, money, and the whole show The low pro ho, she'll be cut like an afro So what you're sayin'



******************************************
N/A - Maleant Data Systems Solutions

1 Quite a plan you boys cooked up here.
Quite a plan.
I'm not sure what upsets me more, that I have four employees that conspired to commit felony fraud, or that I have four employees that are so stupid I found out about it within 30 seconds.
Hearing it out loud, the first one seems worse.
We got sales, manufacturing, design, assembly, logistics teams, they're all ready to go.
All of them on the payroll, all of them here to build me a box.
I have a deal, in principle, with Maleant to buy the box.
The second that we deliver a product that meets those specs, we are cashing checks! And you are the only four people in this building that are fighting me on it! So give me one reason why I don't fire you right now, claw back your options, make you unhireable all over town, one goddamn reason! - Because you can't.
- Excuse me? This agreement says that you have ten weeks to complete a working prototype before the deal expires.
So how are you gonna do that if you fire us? There are maybe eight engineers on earth proficient in middle-out compression.
Five of them work for Endframe, your competition, and three of them are here in this office right now.
So if we're gone, I don't think you're ever going to get your box.
What do you want? I want to build my platform.
Now.
To complete the box project is going to take six months, at least.
So, what I think maybe we should do is, um, take a little tip from your chart there, and we, uh, compromise.
Compromise is the shared hypotenuse of the conjoined triangles of success.
Mm-hmm, yep.
So, uh so, what I'm proposing is we stand up the prototype, that's it.
We're not doing any custom features, no new versions, no maintenance, nothing.
Richard, the Maleant basement.
And no onsite support.
I think you can hire other engineers to do that fucking mole monkey work.
The second we write code that satisfies the basic minimum requirement of the deal, we are off the box and on to the platform.
And that is my final offer.
So, what do you say to that action-- - Whoa! - Ow! Ow! Hey, hey.
You okay? You were standing and then what happened? - It's just a little shocking.
- Oh what were you saying? Did you do we have a deal or? Yeah, Richard, we have a deal.
You have a bloody nose.
That was pretty badass, Richard.
Until it wasn't.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYS) Uh, this is not even a room.
This is a hallway.
Uh, it can't be, because that is a bed, thus, this is a bedroom.
Two entrances and exits, cross drafts ahoy.
And, uh, it is the safest room in the event, unlikely, of a fire.
Oh! Whoopsies.
Don't mind me.
Ah, Fred, this is Jared.
He actually is a, uh a temporary resident.
Oh, uh, while I have you, there were fresh droppings near my cot.
I think you were right.
The Havahart traps don't seem to be working.
I was thinking maybe we could just pick a day and just drench it in hawk urine, because the scent of a predator can keep rodents at bay.
It's funny, we're named Pied Piper, but we're beset with rats.
Little rascals.
(CHUCKLES) Fuck this.
I've been writing quick, bullshit subpar code for 48 hours and I want to kill myself.
How do you do it every day, Dinesh? What a coincidence, I've also been writing bullshit code for 48 hours, and want you to kill yourself.
Guys, please.
Let's just shit this thing out so we can get on to building the platform.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Dang.
- What? - I'm Dang.
- I'm Dang? - Dang.
- What - My name is Dang.
Oh, my I'm sorry.
What, uh, what can I do for you? I'm heading the design team that's building the enclosure for the box.
- It's time for the concept meeting.
- Concept meeting? Okay.
I'm just going to show you a few pictures, and you tell me which ones you like, okay? Okay.
Sure.
(RHYTHMIC DRUMBEAT PLAYS) Look, wait, hold on.
I thought you were going to show me pictures of boxes.
- Like data storage devices.
- Before I can actualize a box, you and I need to develop a shared aesthetic vocabulary.
Otherwise, I have no idea what you're going to want.
Um, I have a lot of work to do right now.
This is work.
This is my work.
What we're doing here could actually save time.
- Okay.
Sure.
Yeah.
Uh - Let's just make this simple.
If the box were an animal, what sort of animal would it be? Leopard? Butterfly? Rhinoceros? Stop.
Animal? Um, it's a box.
Right? Okay, so if you need an animal, make it a box turtle.
How does that sound? So this is all kind of a joke to you? You know what? I don't actually give a flying fuck what this box looks like.
Okay, if it was up to me, I wouldn't even have it in the first place.
So, look, here.
This is a black rectangle.
Make it that.
All right? Because we're going to take it and put it in a hole in a subbasement in a data center, where no one can see it except for a sad man named John with a ponytail.
Okay? Just make it a box.
And please turn off that fucking music.
(MUSIC STOPS) Hello! It appears there has been a mistake.
Is this not my parking space? Sorry, a lot of premium spaces are being reassigned.
14-A, you've been reassigned to lot D.
Lot D? The structure? Beyond the freeway? Anywhere above level three, those are reserved.
There's a shuttle stop on the ground level.
A shuttle? (PHONE DINGS) Call Gavin Belson.
Cell.
(PHONE DINGS, LINE RINGS) Gavin (ON VOICEMAIL): Greetings, friend, I'm not available right now.
-Please leave a message after the beep.
- (HORN HONKS) I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
RICHARD: What the fuck? Why isn't this working? Gilfoyle's preprocessor and my compressor should integrate seamlessly.
This should work.
I may have made my preprocessor slightly faster than you asked me to, Richard.
What do you mean? How much slightly faster? - 200 megs per second.
- You dick.
That's eight times as fast as the specs required.
No wonder our modules aren't running at the same speed.
- Why would you do that? - I tried to make it slow.
I really did.
But I'm not Dinesh.
It's very difficult for me to do shitty work.
So I added a differencing library and then the whole thing just took off like a rocket.
Wait, so you're not processing whole files, just the changes? - That's actually pretty cool.
- Yeah, I thought so too.
That's why I wrote it.
All right, well, I guess I should just revert back.
Right? Slow my preprocessor way down.
Although, Richard, couldn't you just rewrite the compressor to make it faster so it's compatible? I mean, these are minimum speeds, right? Just cause making the box sucks doesn't mean we have to suck at making it.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um, here's one idea.
Uh, what if we actually move upstream and connect the parser BOTH: directly to the compressor seed functions.
Okay.
(CHUCKLES) Well, then the whole thing would really fly.
Yeah.
That would rock.
Hey, Richard, do you have a sec? I have a, uh, preliminary render for you.
What is that? What do you mean? It's a box.
That's not our box, is it? Yes.
It's exactly what you asked me for.
You drew a rectangle and said if it was an animal, it'd be a box turtle.
I mean, are you just going to do the bare minimum and call it a day? Is that, like, what you do? You said it didn't matter, you said you didn't care.
No one's caring about this.
I'm just saying, like, it's just a matter of pride and, like, self-respect.
I mean, that's going to go in brochures, man, that's like an advertisement to you and the company and everything.
I can maybe add some color to it and give the bezel a little slam.
There you go.
Definitely, a slam.
Slam it.
Yeah, maybe add some more lights.
Sure.
Yeah.
Well, hey, uh, what are you doing standing around here talking about it? You should go do it, you know.
Go and make the damn thing.
Make it a jaguar 'cause I have a feeling this baby is going to purr.
I don't care either, but, you know, I think maybe a gazelle is more like it.
Cause it's synonymous with speed.
Fuck that.
A cheetah's faster.
And it kills fucking gazelles.
But I really don't fucking care.
- But definitely cheetah.
- Or a gazelle.
Also, don't throw away the whole jaguar thing, - 'cause they're pretty quick too.
- Or a gazelle.
Ah! Jared, Jesus fuck! What are you doing? Sorry.
I was I was just taking a quiet moment to collect myself.
What the hell is all this shit? My tenant has been leaving my belongings in the alley behind my condo, to make more room for his tenants.
- Your tenant has tenants? - Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) He's Airbnbing my Airbnb.
So, if it's okay with you, I might need to stay a little bit longer, um I can go around the back to get to the bathroom once Fred's here.
- When's he moving in? - Wouldn't we all like to know.
Fred, Erlich Bachman.
You said you'd get back to me about the room.
I don't mean to pressure you, but I need you to decide now.
In this moment, on this phone call.
I am literally standing within feet of three potential candidates whose selves I could easily tell to go fuck Good? What do you mean good? What does that mean, you're good? What? What other incubator? Where? What is the address? Because I want to send them a fucking nice gift.
Fucking "Miami Vice," disgusting architecture! Hey, man.
What are you doing here? What the fuck are you doing here? What do you mean? This is my house.
Crazy, right? This place is huge.
(CHUCKLES) Did you want to? Yes, it would be polite for you to invite me into your home and offer me a Push Pop, yes.
I'm sorry.
You're telling me that we should spend less time together? Absolutely, Chela.
Well, I have to say, this is a big relief.
In all candor, I was feeling the same, but I thought that discussing it with you might be awkward.
Not at all.
You are ready, Chela, to stand on your own, to weather the challenges of the future, and the rumors swirling about your leadership.
Be well, Gavin.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
Wait, what what rumors? There is talk that in the face of a growing threat from Richard Hendricks and Pied Piper, armed with a powerful new CEO, - that you have done nothing.
- (LAUGHS) Well, yes, but-- That by shuttering Nucleus, you have left them to gather strength unopposed, ceding the entire space.
Some are saying this is a show of great weakness.
Who? Who exactly is saying this? Well, people talk.
In the halls, in the cafeteria, on the parking shuttle.
Wait, should should I be worried about this? The beauty is now you have all the answers.
Yes? All right.
Denpok, please.
Will you sit back down? I need your help.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
Clearly, we have come far, but we still have far to go.
Not as far as lot D, but far nonetheless.
JARED: Look what you guys built.
You can't help but be elegant, you're like Audrey Hepburn.
Ah, here they come.
Well, I know we made a big deal about just doing your absolute minimum of your specs, but one thing led to another and, well, Jack, buckle your seatbelt because I'd like to introduce you to Richard, just save it.
Just got off the phone with Calvin Greene, CEO of Maleant.
- They're pulling out.
- What? - How can they just pull out? - Because they shopped our deal and got a better bid from another appliance maker, so Maleant's out, they fucked us.
- Oh.
- Yeah.
So, probably we should just push pause on the whole box thing until we figure out where to go from here.
Okay.
Uh, I actually, I have a I have a question.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I know, Richard, we had an arrangement, but that was all based on closing the Maleant deal.
- So now we have to figure out-- - No, no.
Sorry, um No, my question is, uh, who did they go with? Whose box do they think is that much better than ours? - Oh, uh, Dectosphere.
- Dectosphere? It's a brick with a power cord.
Yeah.
But I hear their new 43-11s, they're going to be hitting close to 75 megs per second.
Uh, we can do 200.
What? Yeah.
You think you can get me in a room with Calvin Greene? BIG HEAD: This is the pool.
The first night I was here, I turned the heat, like, all the way up, and half the water evaporated overnight.
It's crazy.
Well, I hope you own a skimmer because there's a massive turd floating on the surface of your pool.
Who, Fred? Fred's great, man.
He's got this really cool, um, malware cataloguing thing-- Cut the shit, Big Head.
I see exactly what you're doing.
Poaching my tenants? You stole my business model.
What? No.
Dude, it's not like that at all.
It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.
You have any idea how scary that gets at night? So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.
No, I don't.
Well, it's like, 20 million, you know, so I don't really need it, but then they felt weird living here without paying me anything, so they offered me pieces of their startups.
That's all.
You just admitted to starting a competing incubator.
I've caught you in a web of your own lies, haven't I? I don't think so.
Wait, have you? All right, Big Head.
You want to play it that way? If it's a fight you want, then a fight you shall have.
All of you! See you, buddy.
Big Head.
(ENGINE SPUTTERS) Fuck! What are we doing here? Why are we fighting like this? I mean, I'm going to steal your guys, you're gonna steal my guys.
We'll both wield the heft of our considerable fortunes until each of us have nearly nothing left.
Is that really what you want? Me either.
So what do you say we join forces? I'm big enough.
Are you, Big Head? Partners? - Okay.
- Attaboy.
All right, I'm going to take a spin on that fancy Japanese toilet, and then let's get to work figuring out which one of these bedrooms is going to be my office.
GAVIN: Consider the bulldog.
A grotesque monstrosity born of relentless inbreeding.
Riddled with sinusitis, crippled by joint pain.
Chronically flatulent.
A kindly pet, or humanity's cruelest mistake? All right, take it away.
Ladies and gentlemen, just like that horrible creature, the entire Nucleus program was the result of inbreeding.
We mated Hooli engineers with Hooli designers in a Hooli kennel.
Is it any wonder the result was just as unspeakable as that thing? Bring it back here.
Look at that hideous face.
All right, get it out of here! I'm sorry, Gavin.
What's your point? My point is just as not all dogs are as flawed as the bulldog, not all compression plays are as flawed as Nucleus.
Our execution was lacking, but the idea was correct.
Our only mistake was looking inward.
It is now time to look outward.
I mean, this guy did all of the work.
Ten minutes after we leave Calvin Greene's office, he calls me up and says, "Hey, you got me.
How much?" I just showed them the box, Jack's the one who made the deal.
Good feelings, happy feelings.
So Big Head built a better version of your incubator, accidentally.
- Correct.
- And he didn't even realize it? Also correct.
And your solution to that was to go into business with him? Big Head? The guy you once called more useless than a bag of dicks without a handle? Dinesh, don't fall for his "aw, shucks" routine.
He is a shrewd businessman.
And together, we have over 20 million and 36,000 dollars at our disposal.
Now, if you'll excuse me, on to Pied Piper.
I have a board meeting, and this board ain't exactly gonna meet itself.
LAURIE: Our subsequent order of business is the approval of Pied Piper's redraft of the hardware requisition agreement with Maleant Data Systems Solutions.
- Ah, yeah.
- The main event.
We've all read the latest sales agreement, yes? Actually, I don't think I was CC'd on-- So I believe we can move straightforward to a vote? Actually, I'm sorry.
I have an issue with, uh, section 14, paragraph two.
Um, it states that Maleant has exclusive rights to purchase any appliance made by Pied Piper for the next five years.
Oh, uh, yeah.
Jack gave them exclusive rights to the box so that we would get a better price upfront.
Right, but this language is far broader.
They actually have exclusive rights to use the underlying algorithm in any form.
Oh, no.
That's not right at all.
Yeah, so I think, Jack, we're going to have to go back to them and just change the language here.
We're not going to be able to do that.
And, uh, why not? Because that was the specific language which Maleant requested when I got them to pay three times as much for each one of our boxes.
It's a white label deal, so they have the right to resell these boxes in any form they choose.
Yeah, but Jack, if they have exclusive rights to the algorithm, then we can't use the algorithm to build the platform.
For five years.
They wanted seven, I talked them down.
I know, but you said that we could build the platform once we gave you the box.
Yes, but I never specified a timeframe.
Are you serious? I save your ass and you stab me in the back like this? - In the front, Richard.
- Laurie, did you know about this? - I did not.
- Well, then, good, okay.
So it won't go through, because Laurie's not going to vote for it.
Richard, this is complicated.
If one goes strictly by the numbers, these numbers, you have built a box that is so valuable, I am now obligated to vote in favor of it.
Laurie, this deal is peanuts.
The platform could be worth a thousand times what the box is worth.
It could be, correct, however-- This is theoretical, Richard.
You don't have a price point, I do, and she has a fiduciary obligation as a member of the board to vote for the box.
On the page, this is in the best interest of the company.
Am I wrong, Laurie? That is factually correct.
You remember when you tried to end run me and kill the box? Well, she couldn't do a goddamn thing about it then.
And she can't do a goddamn thing about it now.
Simple majority ratifies the agreement, all in favor.
Are you kidding me? What the fuck is going on right now? Laurie.
I wasn't carbon copied on this particular email, so I stand with Richard.
Um, Richard, you know how I voted to fire you a couple months ago? And I said that I did it to stay in the game so that maybe at some point in the future, I could do something to help? Well, Laurie, I know you'll probably replace me on the board and call for a revote tomorrow, but I'm here today.
And I don't have any metrics to back it up, but I honestly believe that the platform that Richard wants to build will be far more lucrative in the long term than any box.
So, at least for today, I'm voting no.
Motion denied.
We will be reconvening tomorrow.
And if I could get a, uh, an email, be CC'd on the latest draft I couldn't sit there and watch them do that to you.
I just hope I don't end up fired over this.
Well, what you did took incredible guts.
And the fact that it probably won't make any difference makes it all the more meaningful.
Right, I saw this nature documentary where a bison fought a lion to protect the rest of the herd.
And it was so moving.
Um, it didn't work, the lion, uh, tore into the bison and then laid waste to the herd, but what courage.
Thank you, Jared.
You guys just had to make a great box, didn't you? - You couldn't phone it in.
- (PHONE RINGS) Uh, guys, Gavin Belson is calling me.
Again.
- What the fuck does he want? - Hello? Richard Hendricks, just checking in, seeing if you heard the news.
- What news? - Mm.
Obviously, you don't have your Hooli news alerts up to date.
Go to the site.
I'll wait.
- Go to the Hooli news website.
- Okay.
It's an ad.
Um, it's an ad.
Hold on.
Just wait four seconds, and you can click to skip it.
Just wait four seconds and then you can click it.
No, it's the kind where you have to watch the whole fucking thing.
It's the whole ad kind.
I thought we stopped doing those.
Goddamn it.
Well, regardless, what you'll see once the paid announcement is over, is that I just closed a 250 million dollar deal to acquire a little company called Endframe.
I thought you'd want to know.
Update those Hooli news alerts.
Also, I invite you to click yes, if our ad experience was relevant to you.
Be well, Richard.
What did he say? Oh, my God.
"Gavin Belson announces deal to acquire Endframe, "a middle-out compression platform company, for 250 million dollars.
" Even after they shit the bed with Nucleus, Hooli gets to build our platform and we don't? (LAUGHS, COUGHS) - What is funny about this? - He's intoxicated.
No.
No yes, but don't you see? Gavin, in trying to fuck us, just saved our asses.
- (COUGHING) - He's right.
He's right.
- (COUGHING) - My gosh.
Oh, my gosh, he's right.
- Holy shit.
- I am so confused right now.
Gavin set a p-- (COUGHING) - He set the-- - The price point.
- Yes.
- Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, thanks to Gavin, Endframe, a middle-out compression platform, is objectively worth 250 million dollars.
Wait, okay.
We are a middle-out compression platform company.
Are we worth 250 million dollars? There's no way the box makes us worth a fraction of that.
Laurie couldn't vote for the platform because she couldn't assign a dollar value to it.
Well, Gavin has just done that.
He's validated the market so there's there's no reason to revote.
We win.
I can't wait to see the look on that AAR prick's face when we come in there and gut him like a-- (COUGHING) - Is he okay? - He's going to be fine.
Welcome, men and ladies of Endframe.
Rather than incestuously promoting the same faces from within, you represent fresh blood, new ideas.
Everything Nucleus was not.
It is my honor to personally welcome you all to Hooli.
Does he really not remember us? How long did you work at Hooli? The last time? Seven years.
I was here for nine.
He was invited to my wedding.
I hope Jack doesn't cry.
I really hope he does.
Hey, Gloria.
Lynn.
- Did they both get fired? - I don't Laurie.
What are you doing here? Where's Jack? Uh, as you may recall, at our board meeting last night, Jack said that he would get his way, and that, in his words, I, quote, "couldn't do a goddamn thing about it," end quote.
Well, in light of recent activities, it appears that I could do a goddamn thing about it.
And I just did.
Jack Barker has been exited.
- Fuck me sideways.
- Indeed.
Effective immediately, you are all at liberty to commence work upon the platform.
Okay.
Wow.
Yeah, uh, uh, I just got to ask, um, with Jack not being CEO anymore, am I CEO again? You are not.
Nor are you, Mr.
Bachman.
I'm sorry, if I'm not CEO, Erlich isn't, Jack isn't, who is going to run Pied Piper then? Officially, and until further notice, this chair will remain empty.
- Really? - Excuse me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah I don't never feel pain 'Cause I done felt too much pain Blood flowing through my veins I'm just doing my thing Get money, baby girl, gold chains I don't never feel pain 'Cause I done felt too much pain Standing in the rain Blood flowing through my veins I ain't never did a thing Getting money, rocking chains We'll never feel the same We the thugs in the game I don't never feel pain 18 wheeler gorillas Black with gold chains Pitch bird like steelers Hines Ward of the crime lords Running through this money screaming "encore" Spending nights with the prime whore But that's the bitch that you're blind for Celebrating on a whim, nigga Pain is Pac above the rim, nigga My bitch rock a bigger gem, niggas 'Cause she was there when it was dim, nigga




******************************************
N/A - The Empty Chair

1 RICHARD: Okay, here's another one.
TechCrunch says, "Laurie Bream spotted lunching at the Rosewood "with yet another rising tech star, Sam Herron.
Could this finally be the new CEO of Pied Piper?" Maybe she's just fucking them all.
It's been ten days.
You know what would be nice? If I found out what Laurie wanted to do with my company from her instead of the fucking Internet.
Richard, the accountants finally agreed to release our books.
Okay.
Hey, Richard.
Is there anything we should be doing? I don't know.
Why are you asking me? I'm not the CEO.
There is no CEO.
Because, apparently, Jack's empty fucking chair is a better choice than I am.
So, maybe maybe ask the chair, see what it thinks.
Say what you will about the chair, but at least it never told me to build a fucking box.
True.
Compared to Richard, it's a lot sturdier.
And it has a lot less of Barker's ass rubbed all over it.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Are you serious? On top of Jack's ridiculous severance package, we spent a thousand dollars on each one of your fucking monitors? We did? Huh.
That's very pricey.
So what? Raviga funded us for $5 million.
There's no way we burned through all that.
Do you have any idea how these deals work? That money's tranched.
What's that? Well, from the Old French for "slice.
" Yeah, try to keep up, Dinesh.
We get our money in stages.
Right? We get $2 million upfront to get us going, to design and build the product, but we don't get the next three million until we take a product to market.
RICHARD: And Jack was okay with hemorrhaging money, because he thought we were launching the box and then getting the next three million in the next few weeks.
But the platform will take way longer to launch than that.
Yes.
So we are effectively a $250 million company who just took $5 million in funding and now we're dead-ass broke.
Our burn rate is astronomical, and every day we sit in limbo like this What if we don't? What if we don't sit in limbo? Like fuck limbo, right? I mean, right now, let's let's fire all these fucking sales assholes, and break the lease on this place and get the fuck out of here.
Can we do that? There's no CEO here to approve any of that.
Yeah.
There's also no CEO here to tell me not to do it, right? That's right.
You're the CTO.
Technically, you're the ranking officer.
Fucking A.
Look, when, or if, a new CEO comes to take over the company, we will do what they say to the best of our abilities.
But there is a very real possibility that there won't be a company for them to take over if we don't do something about it now.
- So, no more surprise waffles.
- What? - No more Chef Amy.
- No! And no more of these stupid offices, okay? We're going to move back to the hostel.
- Fuck.
- RICHARD: Dinesh, we need to cut every corner, save every penny, and plow it into engineers to build the platform.
Okay? Then we will be back on track.
So Gilfoyle, Dinesh, pack up those gold-plated monitors because we are selling them.
Jared, come on.
Let's do this.
- Hmm.
- Well, that sucks.
(ROWDY CHATTERING) Jesus.
(CHEERING) Okay, guys.
Can I have your attention, please! Yeah, next goal wins.
No.
Uh, not Now.
Sorry, it's got to be now.
And so, bring it in, Dang, uh, Chef Amy, Jan the Man, Keith, Northeast regional.
And do you still have your shadow? - Yo! - RICHARD: Hey, there he is.
Okay, uh circle up.
All right, I have some news for you.
Is this about the new CEO? Re/Code is saying it could be Reid Hoffman.
No.
I don't know anything about that.
No, no.
There's no new CEO.
There's no new employees of any kind.
There's actually It's more about you guys becoming former employees.
(MURMURING) So, look We're heading in a different direction.
And what that means is, if I haven't taken you aside and spoken to you privately about staying on, that does mean that you are terminated, immediately.
So, Dang, Chef Amy, Jan the Man, all of Sales, I am, uh, really sorry about all this.
Are you sure that you can fire us, like, legally? Yeah.
Yes, absolutely.
I'm CTO.
I'm the highest ranking officer, so yes answer.
You're you're still CTO? Laurie hasn't fired you yet? No, she has Why would she fire me? Well, Code/Rag said that your tech is mediocre and that's why no one will take the CEO job.
- What? - Yeah.
That's why I assumed that you'd been fired.
Uh, maybe she's waiting till Friday to fire him.
Oh, that makes sense.
No, it doesn't make sense.
That's not what's happening, okay? I'm not getting fired.
That's crazy.
I haven't read this article.
Okay, maybe I'm too busy making the tech awesome, because it's not mediocre.
It's actually turns out, it's fucking revolutionary.
So, I guess that's the truth.
And also, I'm not fired, these guys aren't fired, you all are fired.
Everyone from this wall is fired.
So, enjoy being fired.
Jesus! This is a good apple.
Where did you get this? - Oh, I have a fruit guy.
- Fantastic.
Read me back what we have so far.
Uh, "Bachman and Bighetti shall each include in this venture "any and all portfolio companies.
The exception shall be for Pied Piper.
" Hey, how how come Pied Piper is not a part of it? 'Cause, you know, I actually used to work there, so maybe it should be? Big Head, Pied Piper is no longer an incubating entity.
It would be unfair to you and to me and to them for me to relinquish any of my shares in their company.
And besides, like you, I'm giving up everything else I have of value shares, options, cash, liquid assets.
Wait.
So all my assets? That seems like kind of a lot.
It is a lot, Big Head.
We're both giving up a lot.
And we're both gaining a lot also.
And that's what every successful partnership is about.
Committing fully, blindly, and without concern of the consequences, - like marriage.
- Right.
Oh, here.
Get this down.
In the event of a tie vote, any disagreement shall be settled with a toss of a coin of Mr.
Bachman's choosing.
What the fuck are you doing in here? Can't you see we're having a meeting? Go ahead, Big Head, read that back to me.
Oh, um "In the event of a tie" (JUICER GRINDING LOUDLY) The fucking juicer's broken! This is he second one in two days! CJ Cantwell of Code/Rag writes, and I quote, "Having met this many candidates without closing one, "one can't help wonder why Pied Piper can't land a man.
"Could the vaunted tech of founder Richard Hendricks, "whom I once called 'the next Mark Zuckerberg, ' be turning Pied Piper from a unicorn into a donkey wearing a party hat?" And? And, she's slandering my tech.
It's the one thing that's working around here.
Look, I think if I just talk to her, I can get her to change it.
No.
I do not want you to engage with a muckraker like CJ Cantwell simply to salve your male ego.
My male ego has nothing to do with this, Laurie.
Look, good coders won't want to work for a company they think has shitty tech.
I need to get ahead of this now.
And if I don't, we're done.
Richard, whether you appreciate this or not, I do actually have a plan here.
You can meet with everyone in Palo Alto to replace me as CEO.
I'm not going to tell you how to do your job.
Okay, but I need to do something about this, now.
She-she she's calling us the next Clinkle.
Clinkle, Laurie.
Clinkle.
You you do know what happened to Clinkle, right? Do you want us to be Clinkle? Please, just stop saying "Clinkle.
" It jars the ear.
Fine.
I will have my office set up an interview.
But I want you to present yourself well, Richard.
Be showered, groomed, well-dressed.
And you will need to sit down with our head of PR beforehand to go over talking points.
Why? Because you are in an emotional state, and when you are emotional, you become highly inarticulate.
Well, I don't say that's true.
Okay.
Yes.
Fine.
Sure.
Um And thank you, Laurie.
Before you ask, the answer is yes.
I did blow all these hard drives clean.
- So - GILFOYLE: You really are a moron.
The only way to really blow the hard drives clean is to take a drill and punch a hole through it.
All right, calm down, Snowden.
I zeroed them all out, we're fine.
Welcome, welcome.
Uh, we have lost our lease, so everything must go.
The chairs are arranged in ascending order of lumbar support.
So, have a gander.
Oh, uh, word to the wise: the Haworths are like a spa day for the buttocks.
Yeah, and I have a fragile posterior.
My aunt used to call me "glasshole.
" So, you can take it from me.
Look at these fucking maggots.
Crawling all over our garbage, leaving their slime of mediocrity.
I thought you'd feel right at home in a marketplace, haggling, selling your monkey paws, looking for Indiana Jones in a wicker basket.
Okay.
Marion was in the wicker basket, Indiana Jones was tipping them over, you fucking idiot.
Hi.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Well, how about that? I made my first sale.
I've organized a lot of estate sales, so this is kind of my wheelhouse.
- What? - I have a lot of elderly friends.
Oh, that is a fun item.
That's a hardware fan.
You've got the yellow hoodie on today.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a second.
None of these are signed.
Oh yeah.
Um, it's just my business manager had some questions about the way some of this stuff was being arranged.
Like he said something about how it's not a corporation.
It's just a general partnership or something.
I mean, he told me I didn't understand, which is true, so he wanted to maybe talk to you about it.
So you want to lawyer up, huh? Is that what we're doing? I don't think he has a law degree.
Big Head, I would hope that a handshake deal would be good enough for you.
Because we're headed down a long road, and that road must be paved with trust.
Blind trust.
And you bringing in these so-called "experts" - (PHONE RINGING) - really gives me pause, and it insults my honor.
Huh.
Uh, sorry, hold on.
I got to take this.
I'll be right back.
Sorry.
Hello? Hey.
Uh, how do I look? If I'm being honest, like a ventriloquist dummy.
Uh Okay.
Well, you know, that's actually kind of fitting, because I'm on my way to Raviga right now to meet with a PR person to tell me exactly what to say to a reporter and how to say it.
Well, that does make sense.
You do tend to babble on when you're under pressure.
Why does this thing people say? Why indeed? That was weird.
I just got a call from Laurie Bream's office, at Raviga, asking if I'd want to interview for the job of CEO at Pied Piper.
What? Are you fucking kidding me? That's exactly what I said.
Then I said no, and then we both hung up.
I mean, I assume they hung up.
I had already hung up, so Wow.
(SCOFFS) Wow.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, great.
Big Head.
Big Head! Fucking kidding me? What the fuck is going on? Big Head, you can insult me all you want by involving your self-described shylocks, but to insult Richard and humiliate him, that's like kicking a child who's done nothing to deserve it.
I may not be able to finish my ramen.
I told them no.
Hi there.
Richard Hendricks here to see Dawn Simon, PR.
Sure, she'll be meeting you in the small conference room.
Um, do you need me No, no.
I, uh I know where it is.
It turns out, I actually know something.
I'm not a fucking idiot.
- Richard Hendricks.
Hi.
- Before we get any further, I just want you to know that, um, I'm not going to be yelling at you, but I probably am going to yell.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Uh because this is bullshit.
Honestly, I mean, I get it.
This is your job.
You're in PR.
Your job is to pretty much tell me what I can't say.
I mean, when I talk to this reporter, I probably can't say how fucked up it is that, um, Laurie Bream fired me, and then replaced me with Action Jack Barker.
I probably can't say how the only action he took was to essentially pick the wrong product and then bleed the company dry.
And I probably can't say how fucking pissed off I am that Laurie Bream is out there gallivanting around the Valley, interviewing every dickhole on Earth for my job, including Big Head a man that I fired by the way, and no offense, I like him.
I do actually, he's a close friend of mine, been that way for years.
He is a bit of a simpleton, his name's fucking Big Head.
But, okay, look.
I want to be CEO of Pied Piper, okay? It is my company.
I worked my ass off to build this company, okay? That's my job.
I deserve it.
And it fucking kills me that Laurie is out there trying to give it to someone else, anyone but me.
But I probably can't say that, can I? You can say anything you want to say to me.
(SCOFFS) All right.
Thank you for meeting me, Monica.
You are from? Baltimore.
HL Mencken hails from Baltimore.
Who? Widely perceived as a racist, but his work on the English language is comprehensive, and his perspicuous skewering of evangelicals is laudable.
Monica, my mission here is not merely to have fun.
That's that's okay.
When I voted against you, at the board meeting, I just want Monica, this is not about you, for once.
I brought you here to say I am sorry.
For? Ah, yes, of course.
You are going to make me say it.
Why am I not surprised? I made a mistake with Richard Hendricks.
And out I went, right on my ass.
And then Laurie put that jackhole Barker in to bankrupt the company.
But does she cop to that? No, no, no.
Because the Laurie-tron 6,000 isn't programmed to admit when she's made a mistake.
I made an error.
Wow, um, that's really big of you to admit.
I should not have removed him as CEO, and installing Jack Barker in his place only compounded that error.
But if that's true, then why are you meeting with so many other CEO candidates? I am meeting publically with a number of high-value candidates I know to be unavailable, as well as with a number of less-qualified candidates with whom Richard compares favorably.
That's why you called Big Head.
Yes.
You see, Richard must not be perceived as being the most expedient candidate.
He must be seen as the correct candidate.
This is very exciting for Richard.
I have been impressed by his conduct in a tough situation.
- Mm-hmm.
- He's shown mettle.
Definitely.
Therefore, I will call for a vote at the next board meeting to offer him the job.
That is of course assuming he continues to demonstrate an air of professionalism.
Hi, Dawn.
Are you waiting for someone? Yes.
I'm supposed to be meeting with Richard Hendricks before he sits down with a Code/Rag reporter.
Oh, that's weird.
I saw him earlier.
And that is why I'm just being honest here.
I think that Peter Gregory is better off where he is.
Just saying, because if he knew what Laurie was doing to his company, he probably would want to take a gun and blow his brains out.
Uh, okay.
We should probably start talking about the things that I can say.
Um (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Richard.
Richard Hendricks? Yes.
Who are you? Dawn Simon, Raviga's publicity director.
So that would make you? CJ Cantwell, Code/Rag.
(BEEPS) Thank you, I think I have everything I need.
Please tell me that went well.
Yep.
No, yeah.
It, uh it-it was gone great.
Yep.
It had gone.
It was great.
Uh, she's a she's a great guy.
Really.
Gir girl.
She's she's cool.
She's a cool one.
Cool.
Um, so I can just I can get out here? - Just 'cause I got another thing.
- DAWN: Yeah.
Slow down.
Listen to me.
Look, in my defense, I said those were all the things I can't say, okay.
So it's kind of like I didn't even say them.
But you did say them, at a meeting you scheduled with a reporter.
Reporter? Come on, you're a tech blogger.
Oh, really.
Hard to see why Laurie insisted on a PR rep for you.
Look, uh, just tell me what I can do to kill this? - You want me to spike the story? - Yes, please.
Give me something better.
I don't know, go on a drunken racist Twitter rant, or, uh, get in your car, run over Elon Musk, and give me an exclusive from jail.
Yeah.
Otherwise, I'm posting this at noon tomorrow, so No, no, no, no.
Look.
Look.
If you want to leave, you're going to have to run me over! (SIGHS) These offices were nice.
Now everything looks so bare.
Yeah.
There is a certain sad vulnerability to it.
Have you ever seen a naked dead person? No.
No.
No.
Well, the good news is, we cleared almost $70,000 from selling all this stuff.
That's not enough to afford all the coders we need.
We need at least a dozen.
Where would we even put them now? Shall we? Wait.
Where's my hard drive? What did it look like? It just looked like a normal standard hard drive.
You sure it was in your bag? Yeah, it was in my bag.
Could it maybe have slid out and was next to your bag, which was next to all the hard drives we got rid of? Did you sell my personal hard drive? You didn't happen to wipe that one clean, too, did you? - My personal hard drive? - Yeah.
No! Fuck! So it had our confidential IP on it? Yes.
All the work we did on the platform, the box, everything.
Well, what's gone is not necessarily lost.
Okay, we just need to find it.
I found my retainer in the school dumpster.
I found my biological father in a militia up in the Ozarks.
This should be no problem.
Don't worry, Dinesh, we'll find it.
Uh, does he not know we're moving out? Should we tell him? No.
Jack paid him in full up front, and he seems so at peace.
All right.
All right.
I am such an idiot.
You've got no choice, Richard.
You need to go in to Laurie and just tell her what happened.
What? It's bad enough she's going to find out what I said after this piece posts online.
You want me to go in and tell her right to her face? No fucking way.
You could spin it.
Tell her you're sorry.
I had it.
I had my old CEO job back, - and I fucked it up.
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR) I'll get it.
Ah.
The Super Angel Premium Deluxe.
In the flesh.
Yeah, I had to drive to San Mateo to get one that has auto-reverse.
Why didn't you send your assistant? She was on the phone, so Well, Big Head, it takes a brave man to admit his mistakes, and with this token of apology, you've officially righted your wrong.
Consider the matter resolved.
Cool.
Traditionally the offender shakes the offendee's hand, so you would come to me.
That's an honest Thomas.
Gentlemen, Monica, from the ashes of whatever happens here will rise the Phoenix that shall be known as Bachmanity.
That's what you're going to call your company? Yeah, well, before it was going to be Bachman Capital.
Because I provide the Bachman, and he provides the capital.
Yeah, but then, we compromised, and made it Bachmanity, 'cause it's Bachman from him, and then the "Etti" from me.
So it's two syllables each.
Very much into keeping score, this one.
Have a seat.
I'll go fetch the documents and my Montblanc.
Psst! So, slight hiccup.
I tracked down the woman who bought the drive, but she wasn't interested in selling it back.
Apparently, she's already given it to her elderly father and booked the Geek Squad to set it up for him this afternoon.
(WHISPERING) What about my drive? All our stuff is on there.
I think we're fine.
She said he mostly uses the computer to download photos of old ships.
I don't think he'll be able to find our files even if he wanted to.
Well, I mean, hopefully.
But still Dinesh is right, this is sloppy.
Where does this guy live? Oh shit, Richard, I'm sorry, man.
Initial here and here.
No.
It's okay.
I I deserve it.
It's my own fault.
And you're going to want to sign here.
- Still man, that just really sucks.
- (PHONE CAMERA CLICKING) You know, I bet I bet you wish you could just scrub the whole Internet, like Gavin Belson does, right? Whoa, weird.
Every single one of my signatures looks totally different.
- Wait.
What? - Yeah, look.
This one's in cursive, this one's just printed, and then I, one I just wrote "Big Head," but that's not going to hold up.
No, no, no.
Did you just say Gavin Belson scrubbed the Internet? Oh, yeah.
Yeah, and then they told me to my face, that after Nucleus was shut down, Gavin had one of his execs order them to scrub all negative mentions of Nucleus off of Hooli Search.
Wow.
Okay, when exactly did this happen? No, no.
Actually, uh you told me that you would spike my story if I give you something better.
This is better, right? Yeah.
Light-years better, actually.
Your story's spiked.
Great, okay.
As long as we're trading apples for comparable apples, I've got a fresh and juicy that's ripe for the picking.
Ms.
Cantwell, what say you to an exclusive on the launch of a future financial behemoth? How about we just stick with Gavin? Gavin for Richard? Deal? Done.
Monica, do you really need to be here? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Geek Squad.
- The computer's right here.
You're not wearing the shirt.
I spilled coffee on it.
I'm a nerd.
(LOUD WHIRRING) All right.
We're all set here.
Yes! Can I have my hard drive? (WHIRS) Oh, no.
You fucking dick.
Shit.
You're gonna be replacing it.
You're back.
How did the board meeting go? Well, um You're looking at the past, present, and possibly future CEO of Pied Piper.
- (SCREAMS, LAUGHS) That is fab - Oh - Congratulations! - Jared My captain! "O captain! My captain! Rise up and hear the bells.
Rise up for you the flag is flung for you the bugle trills.
" All right.
Dismissed.
- (LAUGHS) - Well, uh, just to remind you, Pied Piper is still a sinking ship, so Enough with the maritime metaphors.
This is honestly like the best birthday gift that I ever could've asked for.
- It's your birthday? - Oh, I don't know.
The CPS worker couldn't find my birth certificate, but maybe now it is.
And in other good news, we've managed to fill out our engineering team.
Did you tell them that my Fage's off-limits? Oh, that that won't be a worry.
Come meet them.
All right, guys, who wants to start work on the fragment uploader? Uh, Gleb, why don't you and Sanjay take it? Richard, say hi.
Yes, uh, hello.
I am, uh, Richard Hendricks, the CEO of Pied Piper.
Welcome aboard.
- ENGINEERS: Hello.
- What the fuck is going on here? We got a little creative.
Uh, I read that the woman who started Pegg'd built her entire app using a team of coders from India, she never met in person.
And it only cost $15,000.
So, yeah, so we figured why limit ourselves to a few expensive people in the Valley, when we could afford a full complement if we outsourced? Uh, Richard, I know we said that we sold everything in the offices to pay for these guys, but that was not exactly true.
Um, we kept one thing.
Okay.
RICHARD: Oh, wow.
It's the CEO chair.
Ah.
Have a seat.
Okay.
Okay, uh Well, uh, why don't we, uh, go around the room or screens or whatever, and, uh, introduce ourselves? Hello, my name is Gleb.
I am in Bulgaria.
Hello, I am Sanjay.
I am here in Mumbai, India.
- You having trouble? - No.
I am Elisabet.
I am speaking to you from Estonia.
Uh, thank you for the - Whoa! - (CLATTERING) It's fine.
It's fine.
It's fine.
- I got it.
I got it.
It's fine.
- Dude.
You're making a great first impression.
Sorry.
Can we go to the do the names one more time? (SPANISH RAP SONG PLAYING)

N/A - Bachmanity Insanity

1 Okay, one extra-large, virgin margarita.
- Thank you, Richard.
- What took you so long? Uh, I actually, uh, I met a girl.
It's called the bartender, she works here.
No, no.
It's a real girl.
And I actually got her real phone number.
Check you out, Mr.

Where is this individual? Um She's right over there.
- The tall dude? - No, behind him.
Oh, she must be hiding behind that attractive girl in the red sweater.
No, it is the attractive girl in the red sweater.
- Oh.
- Can we stop looking at her? She's magnificent.
Are you sure it's not the tall guy? Why are we surprised that young Richard is garnering the attention of ladies? After all, he's king again.
Women like that.
Okay, so she's a founder hounder.
Come on, no, it-- it's not like that.
But you did tell her that you're the CEO of your own company? It came up.
But I mean, honestly, how else was I going to explain that me and my friends were at a bar? That is a good point.
Anytime you're near a woman, it is important to explain why.
Otherwise, they get nervous.
- Gentlemen - RICHARD: Hm To Pied Piper's past, and now present CEO.
- Oh, what about future? - Jared, we'll worry about that later.
Tonight it's about Richard.
To Richard.
(THEME SONG PLAYS) I think you'll find I'm a I'm a I'm a pretty tolerant boss, but, Gleb, your-- your last commit, you did use spaces over tabs.
Um, I don't know why you'd commit to that, uh, so just tell me why on earth you-- you would do something like that? Is not so big a deal.
They're very much the same, yes? Yes, yes, he's right.
They're very much the same.
No, no, sorry, they're-- they're not the same.
At least, not in my book.
Um, um, one is right, and the other is wrong.
(CHUCKLES) Why didn't anyone tell Gleb to use tabs? Yeah, we did.
And it's in the company style guide.
I just don't think Gleb realized how seriously Richard takes this stuff.
Yeah, I've honestly never understood it myself.
I mean, once the code goes through the compiler, there's effectively no difference.
I know, but coders go, like, batshit over it.
At Hooli, I once saw two engineers get into a fight so vicious, - they almost made physical contact.
- What? RICHARD: Okay, guys, uh, back to work.
Uh, Gleb, Sanjay, everyone, do you understand tabs? Yes, yes.
You have made this very clear as clear as crystal.
Okay.
Good, that's my little thing, and I'll hand you back to Dinesh now.
He's, uh, he's the man with the plan, and the, uh, pretty cool tan.
(CHUCKLES) - It's not a tan, it's-- - Yeah, I know, I know.
Uh sorry.
This is how I was born.
Hey, uh, Elisabet? Hi.
Um, before you go, I just wanted to say that I thought your last commit was very impressive.
Oh.
Thank you.
Almost as nice as the fingers that typed it.
(LAUGHS) - Just call it like I see it.
- ELISABET: Thank you.
Speaking of seeing, I will see - you tomorrow.
- ELISABET: Yes.
You will.
- (CHUCKLES) Bye-bye, Dinesh.
- Bye, Elisabet.
(CHUCKLES) - Yuck.
- What? You don't actually think she was flirting, do you? She works here.
She's paid to interact with you.
Just like that bartender that Richard thought he was flirting with.
Uh, actually, she's not a bartender.
And for your information, we've been trading texts.
And, uh, we're going for drinks later, so Great.
If you go to the bar she works at, you can probably drink for free.
Again, uh, not a bartender.
Okay, she works at Facebook.
So she makes a lot more money than I do or you do.
And, um, she's definitely not a founder hounder.
So sorry.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, none of that adds up.
Hey, guys, check out Code/Rag.
What, did the Gavin piece post? Indeed it did.
Oh, "Gavin Belson's Hooli-Scrub Scandal.
" - Awesome.
- Man, Gavin cannot be happy about this.
(PEOPLE SHOUTING) - (CROWD BOOING) - Stay close.
Back up, back up.
You're on private property, back to the sidewalk.
- You're gonna get arrested.
- Hey, Gavin! Hello, I'm (CROWD CHEERING) You know, a hundred years ago, men like me could've had people like that killed.
Just like that.
You think captains of industry like Andrew Carnegie or Cornelius Vanderbilt would've batted an eyelid? Please.
(SIGHS) Times sure have changed.
Or have they? Of course they have.
And for the better.
Unless All right, forget it.
What are we doing about this article? Can we sue this Cantwell woman for libel? Gavin, libel laws don't really apply when what's written is true.
It's my understanding you did in fact instruct Nucleus engineers - to obscure negative Hooli-Search--- - I know what I did.
Forget libel.
What about this unnamed Hooli insider she keeps quoting.
Everything this person is saying is obviously covered by a nondisclosure agreement.
Let's sue that person.
We don't know who that person is.
And reporters generally don't give up their sources.
Well, then I'll just have to light a fire under this reporter's ass, won't I? You know, there was a time, not so long ago, when it could've been a literal fire.
But as discussed, those days are gone.
Unless All right, forget it.
You people are useless.
Thank you.
You're excused.
It's Gavin Belson for CJ Cantwell, please.
She'll know what it's regarding.
EHRLICH: Now, the stage should be here.
With Yeezy or someone comparable.
Now, I have yet to land on a theme.
Most people who rent Alcatraz for parties tend to go with the prison theme.
Hm how much would it cost to make this look as if it were never a prison at all? Spare no expense, and if you think it would be cool, I would love to have some sort of chocolate moat here, with little boats floating down a field with graham crackers and marshmallows.
It's been a childhood dream of mine.
And get the best chocolatier, we want to impress.
I'm inviting every asshole from the Valley to attend.
- You're inviting assholes? - Absolutely.
Assholes, shit dongles, any foe or enemy I've made over my storied career will be here.
That way, when I take this stage and unleash the power of Bachmanity, they'll all be in the front row.
Erlich, uh, can we talk for a second? What is it, Big Head? I thought I told you to go watch something on your iPad.
I think we may have a problem.
That Code/Rag reporter I talked to says that Gavin Belson is threatening to sue her if she doesn't tell him who she spoke to.
- So? - So, she spoke to me.
No publicity is bad publicity.
This might be great timing.
Exactly the reason that we are partners.
Okay, yeah.
Except if Gavin finds out it was me that talked to the reporter, then he'll know I violated my NDA.
And then he could come after my entire settlement if that happens.
All two million.
I mean, 20 million.
Big Head, I'm not going to yell.
And I'm not going to hit you.
I'm just gonna ask you nicely, why in the holy fuck didn't you tell me you signed an NDA, you sweet, helpless, little piece of shit? Well, that's the thing about the NDA, is that the NDA is actually covered under the NDA.
So if I told you about the NDA, it would've been a violation of the NDA.
And what about speaking with the reporter? What would that be? Yeah.
Shit.
So, what do you think I should do? - I could call her back and-- - No! Let me handle it.
You go wait in the helicopter.
- Go.
- Okay.
Sasha, I'm going to need to go back to the mainland.
- Oh, is there a problem? - Oh, no, no.
Full steam ahead.
Mainland.
This is an island.
That's the theme.
Hawaiian.
We'll have a luau.
Yeah, somebody called me that in high school, and the nickname just stuck.
- Pakistani Denzel.
- I mean, I don't see it.
But everybody else does.
So Maybe they should call him American Dinesh ? - (BOTH LAUGH) - Stop.
Only if you stop first.
- No, you stop first.
- You stop first.
- You go first.
- No, I think you should.
Okay, I'll stop.
Bye.
What's your end game here? You think after your tired rap, she's going to hop on a plane, fly halfway across the world, - and fuck you? - My motivations are pure.
Her and I have, like, a real connection.
She's so, like, nice and she's so down to earth, that it's like she has no idea how attractive she is.
You don't know how attractive she is.
Packet loss over Estonian broadband is terrible.
She could be hideous.
Well, I can't imagine that would matter to Dinesh one iota.
Right.
Cause she's nice, and, uh, very talented, and has a great laugh.
And with any luck, she's not a dogface.
How was your date with Winnie? Uh, well, pretty good, considering she's still in the other room.
Baller, you got lucky on the first date.
Yeah, did a little bit, uh, not everything.
I mean, I slept in my jeans.
Well, take your time.
Hunger is the best sauce.
You're right.
Uh, we did a little bit of under the shirts and, like, finger banging.
Oh, hey.
- Hey, I'm Winnie.
- Oh.
- Hi, I'm Dinesh.
- Hi, I'm Jared.
- It is an honor to meet you.
- Okay.
- God, what a pleasure.
- Thanks.
I'm Gilfoyle.
Are you a bartender? - I work at Facebook.
- As a bartender? I had a stuffed animal named Winnie.
WINNIE: Oh, wow.
I mean, it wasn't technically an animal, I took a Ziploc bag and I stuffed it with old newspaper and then I-- I drew a smile on it.
Okay, well, uh, shall we have some coffee, my lady? - Sure.
Let's do it.
- Okay.
All right.
We're already on to Elizabethan nicknames.
This is serious.
- They'll be Ren Faire-ing soon.
- JARED: It's healthy.
And now that Richard's dating, uh, in solidarity, I think I might get back out there myself.
You make it sound like you've chosen not to date.
Yeah, absolutely.
I wanted to focus on Pied Piper.
But, yeah, maybe now I'll fan out my plumage, so to speak, and see what pretty birdies might share my nest.
Hey, Jared.
If you fuck any pretty birdies in my server room, put a tie on the doorknob, won't you? Oh, as a signal.
Yeah, good thinking.
Okay, so I'll just get the car keys and then give you a lift home.
Okay, my lady? My lord.
Oh.
My lady.
(BOTH CHUCKLE) Okay.
So, Richard tells me you guys are building deep nets into your platform? Oh, really? What other company secrets did he blab to you? Well I'm a bartender, I wouldn't understand all the science-y talk, right? - TouchÃ©.
- So you do AI at Facebook? No, but when I was at MIT, I did my master's thesis on game playing AIs.
I did a lot of machine learning stuff.
For gaming? How does that work? It's on my GitHub.
Do you want to check it out? Gavin said he was gonna haul me into court and have a judge compel me to give up my source, or go to jail.
Okay? I am not going to jail.
No, no one's going to jail, CJ.
Although, if you did, going to jail for protecting your source would make you some kind of First Amendment hero.
It's pretty much the best thing that can happen to a journalist.
Journalist? Okay, I'm a tech blogger.
Okay? I write stories for the internet about the internet.
I am not going to jail for that.
I know it is an inconsequential shit job.
It doesn't really contribute to culture in any way whatsoever.
We've established that you don't have any journalistic integrity, but what would it cost to buy you some? WINNIE: Then I figured out a way to train a convolutional net to play Atari 2600 games.
- Uh-oh.
- What? Spaces.
Yeah, so what, you guys use tabs? In this house, yes.
Richard is a bit of a zealot in the Tabs V.
Spaces holy war.
I get that, for his company.
Sure.
This goes much deeper.
I think he believes that people who use spaces are less than.
Huh I wouldn't mention this to Richard.
You don't want to see him throw a hissy fit.
Okay.
Shall we away, my lady? - Nice to meet you guys.
- Have fun.
- Bye.
- GILFOYLE: Bye.
I actually kind of liked her.
Too bad Richard's going to fuck it up.
So, you moved the swimming pool? Yeah, it just felt like it was way too far from the house, like, crazy far.
So I had this company come and just move it closer.
Uh-huh.
But then you moved it back? Yeah, turns out the guy who built this place knew exactly what he was doing, and the pool was right where it needed to be the whole time.
But now I know that for sure, which feels good.
Nelson, do you like being wealthy? Yeah.
Oh, man, it's awesome.
So you want to stay wealthy? - Okay, yeah, sure.
- Great.
Here are the three things you need to do, all right? One, stop moving the swimming pool.
Oh, yeah, okay, I can do that.
What else? Two, you need to manage your expenses and track your receipts a little bit better than this.
I'm only as good as the information I have.
- Oh, you're great.
- No, I wasn't fishing for compliments.
And three, I sense that people are taking advantage of you.
- (PHONE VIBRATES) - Oh.
Sorry, hold on.
Oh, it's Erlich, I should probably grab this.
Erlich Bachman, a perfect example.
You gave him signing power on your personal checking account? Yeah, he's my business partner.
You're not structured as a corporation.
You're a general partnership.
So he's essentially your spouse.
- That's very dangerous.
- But I trust him.
He's actually trying to save us money right now, so hold-- hold on.
Hey, man.
Big Head, wondrous news.
I eliminated the Gavin problem, and at the exact same time, I closed funding on our first strategic investment.
We bought a blog.
Oh, cool.
How much do blogs cost? - What? - Oh, nothing.
We practically stole it from them.
- What? - (WHISPERS) I'm bullshitting.
Half a million dollars.
Let me talk to him, please.
Uh, hey, Erlich, could you talk to, uh, my business manager for a second.
No, I've got to jet, but tell him I'll see him at the party.
Good day, partner.
Okay, cool.
About the blog - 500 grand.
- Oh, God.
I know, we practically stole it, right? WINNIE: Your roommates are really funny.
I like them.
They gave me a little shit.
Oh, well, you can't take that personally.
Oh, it's fine.
They gave you shit too.
Oh, really? What about, like my hair or something? No.
They tried to convince me you were some sort of formatting Nazi about tabs versus spaces.
What? Me? Nazi? (CHUCKLES) (HITLER ACCENT) That's ridiculous.
That's what I said, I mean, I use spaces.
So what? Mm Yeah, so what? See, they said you'd have a hissy fit if you found out.
Mm-mm.
Hissy fit, me? No.
- I know.
- You know.
I know.
I mean, make up your mind, guys, am I a Nazi or am I a guy who throws hissy fits? You know? Am I a Nazi who throws hissy fits? I hope not.
That was Hitler.
That was like his whole deal.
I mean, that's pretty insensitive to the Holocaust, don't you think? Cause that's, like, what Hitler did, you know, he just, like, killed so many people, so tragic, such a tragic time.
- Yeah.
- I'm so glad we're not doing that anymore.
I mean, we, like I like I was, you know, whoa! I want them all to die.
I don't, I don't care.
I mean, I do care, don't-- don't kill them-- them-- Jews.
Uh, anyway, what do you want to what do you want to order here? - Is that our P-to-P protocol? - Yeah, I'm just hacking for fun.
I figured out a way to use our compression for RTC, so Video chat? Yeah.
I think it could be better resolution than Hooli-Chat.
Even over 3G.
It could just be like a fun, cool feature in the platform, you know.
And then coincidentally you'll finally be able to see what Elisabet actually looks like.
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh.
I hadn't thought of that.
If you worked half as hard on the platform as you do trying to ogle strange Slavic women, maybe our shares would finally be worth something.
Hey, uh what the hell was that? Can you give us slightly more, Richard? Why did you tell Winnie that I think people who use spaces over tabs are stupid? - Because you do.
- No, I don't.
And if I did, which I don't, why would you say that behind my back, to her? I mean, things were just going so well, until she-- - (WOMAN CHUCKLES) - That was completely lovely.
- Yeah, it was really nice.
- You're really something.
- I'll give you a call later, okay? - Okay, cool, yeah.
Great, sounds good.
Bye, Jared.
Bye.
Jared? Yeah? Who was that? Oh, that was Carol.
So, uh, Jared, did-- did you just have sex with her? What? I'm an adult, and like the rest of you, I'm a sexual being.
You fucked her in the garage? Well, it's the server room and my bedroom.
What, so you just meet a woman, and then you have sex with her? How often does this happen? Well, if you're asking me how many times I've been in love, the answer is two.
But the rest I won't talk about.
It's untoward.
Russ was right, this guy fucks.
Who was that gorgeous gazelle in the driveway? Well, I've said all I care to, let's move on.
She let Jared have sex with her.
Jared, nice.
Using that dick.
Gents, I'd like to invite you to what promises to be the social event of the season.
Bachmanity Insanity.
Alcatraz? Don't worry, it will be unrecognizable.
Jared, with regards to the you need a plus one? Oh, no thank you.
I think it's too early for that.
Good idea.
Don't bring sand to the beach, there's already pussy there.
Richard, I assume you'll be taking your woman friend? You know what? Yes.
She and I will be there together.
I'm going to make this work, despite all your little attempts to sabotage my relationship.
You can do anything you put your mind to, Richard.
Including turning Alcatraz into Hawaii.
(LAUGHS) You okay? Yeah.
Yeah, all good.
Great.
(CHUCKLES) - You know - What? My roommate's going out of town tomorrow, so if we want to come back here after Erlich's party Oh.
Okay, yeah.
Sure, that sounds good to me.
- All right, it's a date.
- See you then.
(CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) Richard, what's wrong? Nothing.
Nothing, literally it's all good.
Come on.
(CHUCKLES) - Oh, my God! - I'm sorry.
Your roommates were right, - you really hate spaces.
- No, no, no.
I don't, it's not hate, hate's a strong word.
Um, truth be told, I do have a slight preference for tabs.
But that's only because I'm anal and because I prefer precision.
Well, not to pick a fight here, but if you really care about precision, wouldn't you use spaces? - Nn - But whatever.
Once it goes through the compiler, it's the same thing.
Right? Yeah.
Yeah, technically yes.
I guess, I just I just don't understand why you-- anyone would use spaces over tabs.
Like, if it's all the same, why not just use tabs? Because it could look different on other people's computers.
Tabs create smaller file sizes, all right? I run a compression company, trust me, I've devoted my life to minimalizing file sizes.
It's what I do.
I mean, I do not get why anyone would use spaces over tabs.
I mean, why not just use Vim over Emacs? (CHUCKLES) - I do use Vim over Emac.
- Oh, God, help us! Okay, uh you know what? I just I don't think this is going to work.
I'm so sorry.
Uh, I mean like, what, we're going to bring kids into this world with that over their heads? That's not really fair to them, don't you think? Kids? We haven't even slept together.
And guess what, it's never going to happen now, because there is no way I'm going to be with someone who uses spaces over tabs.
Richard! Wow.
Okay.
Goodbye.
- One tab saves you eight spaces! - (DOOR SLAMS) - (BANGING) - RICHARD: Oh! - (RICHARD MOANS) - Oh, my God! Richard, what happened? I just tried to go down the stairs eight steps at a time.
I'm okay, though.
See you around, Richard.
Just making a point.
Oh! Huh This new video chat protocol is making your image crystal clear.
Wait wait one second, Dinesh.
Uh, Dinesh, I can't see you, it's all black.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't give the camera permission to access the video chat, hold on.
- Boom! - Yes! I can see you now.
It's me! Pakistani Denzel! Yes! The Denzel who is from Pakistan.
This video quality is great, right? Looks so sharp.
That's what we do here at Pied Piper.
It-- it's very impressive.
Um, I will have to tell my boyfriend all about it.
Boyfriend? You never mentioned a boyfriend.
Oh, no? Um This is because he's now just husband.
Um, I keep forgetting to say this, husband, but it is very good to see you this way, and we will talk more tomorrow.
- Yeah, we'll talk-- - (COMPUTER BEEPS) Either she froze time, met and married the man of her dreams, unfroze time, and hopped back on to vid chat with you, or you're the dogface.
Which do you think it is? I'm on the fence.
What the fuck is going on? Richard found a girl, you have a girlfriend, Jared is getting laid with a girl.
(PHONE VIBRATES) Hi, Mom.
(HAWAIIAN MUSIC PLAYS) Oh, God.
Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie, Winnie.
Sweet, sweet Elisabet.
Gentlemen, mahalo for coming.
You must taste the breaded humuhumunukunukuapua'a, flown in fresh this a.
m.
- What is mumu-- - It's breaded.
Get ready.
In T-minus five minutes, Big Head and I are going to take that stage and I am going to ejaculate my success all over the faces and hair of my fiercest rivals.
Like some sort of vengeful viscous web of payback.
- Erlich? - Yes.
One moment.
Sasha, you are doing an exceptional job.
I mean, I see I see no evidence that we are not in Hawaii.
Hm we have a problem.
Just several of our vendors are saying that your checks have bounced.
Um, Sasha (SPEAKS HAWAIIAN) I'll be back.
Big Head, Big Head.
Why are our checks bouncing? If you had responded to any of my phone calls, I would've explained it to you.
Who the fuck are you? Uh, Erlich this is my business manager, Arthur Klaiman.
Klaiman.
I knew it was something with Clay.
As I was explaining to Mr.
Bighetti, I've finally managed to get a handle on his finances.
Our finances.
Continue.
After your considerable outlay on lifestyle, this party and half a million dollars on a website, you're functionally insolvent.
Big Head, you're broke? We're broke, dude.
Erlich, it's time.
You have my number.
I left it on your voicemail.
Several times.
ANNOUNCER: Titans of the tech world, I give you Nelson Bighetti, Erlich Bachman, - and Bachmanity! - (HORN BLARES) Aloha.
Uh, that means hello.
Oh, and goodbye.
I saw you in my dreams We were walking hand in hand On a white sandy beach Of Hawaii We were playing in the sun We were having so much fun On a white sandy beach Of Hawaii The sound of the ocean Rocks me all night long Ahhh Ahhhhhh Of Hawaii



******************************************
N/A - To Build a Better Beta

Shit.
I I swear I deleted a picture, but when I clicked back to the album, the icon reappeared.
It undeleted itself.
But I can't get it to happen again, so Hey, Richard, totally out of the blue, do you know how we might be able to find that bug? No, Dinesh.
We are not releasing the beta.
We integrated the neural net a week ago.
The platform is full of bugs.
But that is what a beta is for.
You give it to people in the real world, they use it, and that is how we find the bugs.
Richard, Reid Hoffman says if you're not mortally embarrassed by the quality of your initial release, you've released too late.
Okay.
We already are mortally embarrassed.
Okay? We move in and subsequently out of our offices, mainly because it was too expensive, we fired two CEOs, we've pivoted to a box, and then pivoted back.
Any more bad word of mouth and we will be royally fucked.
Where's Gilfoyle? Hey, Gilfoyle, the deletion issue is ducking me again, and and, um, I'm sorry.
- Oh, hey, Richard.
- Hi, Tara.
I need to borrow your fella here for a second.
All right, babe, I gotta go.
Hey, when you check out the settings view, can you let me know if there's something weird that happens with the submit button? It was a little weird when I was doing QA.
- Yeah, okay.
- Sorry, the the settings view for? - The beta.
- The beta for? Pied Piper.
It's a promising compression company that doesn't pay very well.
- You sent her the beta? - I did.
Are you fucking insane? It's not ready.
It's riddled with bugs.
Really? Cause I've been test driving it all day, and it's pretty fucking awesome.
- Really? You think so? - Yeah.
For real.
Congratulations, Richard.
It's so fucking cool.
And when the neural net kicks in, it's gonna be rad.
But, you know, I did have one problem, though.
I tried to restore an old file and it asked me to confirm twice.
Yeah, well, that was a bad merge.
It's been there for months.
I fixed it in ten seconds.
Richard Maybe.
Yeah, maybe beta.
- Hi, Dinesh.
- Tara.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYS) Wait, that can't be right.
How can Bachmanity still be so far in the hole? Look at all this shit that Big Head is selling.
He was renting virtually everything in the house.
He rented that cannon? It was for display purposes only.
So you forfeit your deposit.
It's a cannon.
What's he supposed to do, not fire it? That was the provision.
So that's it then, I guess.
Big Head's really broke.
You know what? He's young.
He'll get past it.
Nelson is not the only one who should be worried.
- You were partners.
- Fair point.
But shuttering a company in the tech world is almost a rite of passage, like herpes simplex one.
At first, it's ugly and embarrassing and you're disgusted by your own dick.
But after a while, in the larger scheme of things, you realize it's really Mr.
Bachmann, you structured Bachmanity as a general partnership.
Then, with no money in the bank, you threw a million-dollar luau on Alcatraz.
You're on the hook for that.
And even declaring bankruptcy isn't going to absolve you of these debts.
- Bankruptcy? - It's none of my business.
Good luck.
Wait, where are you going? We need you.
You're our business manager.
There's no business remaining to manage.
Good day, Mr.
Bachmann.
Hey, good news.
They said we can each keep one of the cannonballs, so not a total loss, right? All right, so I've set up a sign-up page for the beta, and we're gonna keep it small and secure, so that means we're limited to ten invite codes each to send out.
I've already got my list.
It's people that I know personally, and, uh, people that I know I can trust.
Hm, we only get ten each.
This could be prickly.
Well, I'm out.
I don't trust anyone.
It's a huge part of my belief system.
You sent the beta to Tara.
Yeah, there was a transactional nature to that exchange - which I'll get into if you want.
- Pass.
But it doesn't mean that I trust her, and I certainly don't trust anyone else.
Oh, in other words, you have no friends.
On principle.
I could make what rises to your low standards of a friend any time I want.
Sure you could.
Gilfoyle, if you're not gonna use your ten invites, - could Dinesh and I have them? - Sure.
Knock yourselves out.
Loser.
He's got no friends.
- Okay - JARED: Miriam, Sylvia Oh, Samantha! (CHUCKLES) I almost forgot her.
You know, Jared, you can have all ten of Gilfoyle's invites.
- Much appreciated.
- Yeah.
- (PHONE VIBRATES) - Monica, hello.
Um, did you honestly think that you could send me an email telling me that you were launching the beta without sending me the beta? Come on.
I'm dying to see it.
Well, I think the whole point of it, Monica, is to get the beta into the hands of unbiased people so they can give us an honest feedback.
Besides, I I just gave out my ten invites.
Oh, if Monica wants an invite, I could, like, squeeze her on my list.
- (WHISPERS) Are you sure? - Yeah, no problem.
Okay, Monica, well, you're in luck.
Dinesh has decided to give you one of his codes, so Great.
I promise I'll find something terrible to say.
Okay, so I did a rough accounting of your assets and liabilities.
Jared, don't look at me like that.
Just give it to me straight.
All right.
Your house has appreciated in value since you bought it, but if you sold it now for what Zillow and Redfin think it's worth I'd still be half a million in the hole.
Now, that's the bad news.
- Is there good news? - Well, it's unclear.
I I went back through your records.
Uh, at first, I'll admit a bit voyeuristically, uh, to see where all of the money went, and apart from the party expenses, - which were (LAUGHS) staggering - Yeah.
Fuck, yeah.
But one number jumped out at me.
Now, whoever did your accounting earmarked almost 70 percent of Big Head's settlement money for taxes.
Seventy percent? Even in Taxo-Alto, which I coined, would be half that.
Where did that money go? Well, that is the six-million-dollar question.
I may have the answer.
I'm sorry.
You're accusing me of impropriety? You, the man who spent $20,000 renting giant fiberglass tiki heads, and $40,000 more when one of them was misplaced on the way back to the rental house? I told you it wasn't misplaced.
I know exactly where it is.
It's at the bottom of the bay.
I called you a thief because you, sir, have stolen from us.
Nelson, come on.
You can't possibly believe this.
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize to him.
- Oh, right.
Sorry.
- Thank you.
Arthur, you listen to me, and you listen good.
I have people calling me 40 times a day asking for their money.
I even considered selling my house to pay them.
So you are going to go in your little fucking piggy bank right now and pay back every fucking kopeck that you stole from Big Head, and if you don't, we're gonna take our little show on the road, perhaps perform it for a man named the D.
A.
Ridiculous.
Very well.
Game on.
Let's go, Big Head.
Wait.
I may have moved around some of your money in a way that wasn't exactly conventional.
- Give me back Big Head's fucking money! - Yeah! - Sorry.
Sorry.
- No, you did good.
I can't, because I don't have it.
Hey, Marc, we may have a problem.
What's up? Well, a buddy of mine at Datatrode sits next to a guy who just got invited to Pied Piper's beta.
Shit.
They're already in beta? Should I tell Gavin? Fuck no.
We're still two or three months out.
Yeah, if he hears Pied Piper's already in beta, trust me, he'll lose his shit.
Fine.
But if it ever comes up, I didn't hear about this.
- GAVIN: And this came in when? - MAN: 43 minutes ago.
And deleted six minutes after that.
Fortunately, the filters, which I had installed, sir, caught the relevant keywords.
I decided to walk it to you personally.
An employee's withholding critical information about a competitor.
This is a fireable offense.
You want me to bring this guy in? No.
Acting on this would expose the fact that we're reading employees' private emails, destroying the spirit of trust and freedom to innovate that I've worked so hard to build here at Hooli.
You know, it makes you wonder if the word Hooli has any meaning for these people whatsoever.
- Is there anything I can do? - Yeah.
Get me a look at that Pied Piper beta.
I will figure out a way, sir.
Finally.
Where the fuck have you - Hey, thanks for the lift, Kevin.
- Yeah, no worries.
Oh, Kevin, this is Dinesh, one of my coworkers.
Dinesh, this is Kevin.
We met at Phil's Coffee.
Hey.
We're friends now.
Isn't that right, Kevin? Yeah.
All right, my friend.
I should get to work, so thanks for the lift.
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the coffees.
Catch ya later, my friend.
That was my friend, Kevin.
Congratulations.
You now have one friend.
He also said there was a bug on the landing page.
- Well, how severe is it? - Not bad.
Compared to the rest of what he said, it's nothing.
Guys, uh, you might as well hear this from me.
Uh, I just had a long talk about the beta with my friend, Todd Chambers.
- The Dropbox guy? - Yeah, he was employee number 11.
Why did you send it to him? He hates everything.
Well, because I thought he would be honest with me, - and, um, and he was.
- Quite honest.
Uh, he said that in the 15 years he's been working in the Valley, our beta was the best beta he's ever seen.
- By far.
- What? Really? I don't want to count our chickens before they hatch.
I mean, three percent of hatchlings are born mutated or dead, but we may have a healthy brood on our hands.
I'm getting the same reaction.
I mean, a few bugs here and there, but overall, they love it.
We might be holding pocket aces here.
Awesome.
Hey, guys.
- How you holding up? - RICHARD: Good, yeah.
I mean, just trying to make sense of all the feedback.
Well, you know, I guess you just can't let it get in your head.
- Don't you mean go to my head? - What did I say? You said, get in your head, like it's, like it's a bad thing, but it's not.
- It's great.
People love it.
- Really? Yeah.
Yeah.
I can't believe it myself.
- They're flipping out.
- That's awesome.
That And that's that's for the beta that you sent me? No, Monica.
It's for the other beta that we've got kicking around here.
(CHUCKLES) I mean, I I I have an inbox full of raves here for the upload performance, the mobile, the What about what about the interface? Did people have any issues with that? No, not at all.
Why? Do Do you have any issues with the interface? I I haven't actually had a chance to look at it yet.
Are you serious? You've been sitting on the beta for a day after busting my balls about not getting an invite.
- Pretty fuckin' lame.
- Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah.
Lame.
I just got an email from my friend, Max Karnow.
He says, I heard the beta's awesome.
Can I get a look? Guys, I think we're starting to get some buzz.
You know, maybe we should talk to Laurie about moving up the official launch? You want to move it up? Yeah, I think we're ready.
I mean, do do you think you can set the meeting? Yeah.
Yeah, I'll I'll go tell Laurie right now.
Okay.
What was that about? She's fucking weird.
Hey, Richard, um, if your friend Max Karnow needs an invite, you know, I could probably - squeeze him on my list.
- Are you sure? Yeah.
I'll have to freeze out one of my boys, but they'll get it.
Just shoot me his email.
The perpetrator has been losing money for other clients for years, was lying to us and funneling our money to said other clients, therein, fucking us.
I'm sorry to say this is not an uncommon occurrence.
Wait, it's not an uncommon? So then it Okay, got it.
So if it makes any difference, I'd like to vie for a lesser sentence if after he makes full restitution he would write a very convincing public apology, preferably Mr.
Bachmann, an action like this is very expensive and time-consuming, and as you've already pointed out, even if you do prevail, the money is gone, unless you win a court order allowing you to raid other innocent people's bank accounts, and that's a tough sell, even for a plaintiff who's more, uh, sympathetic.
Are you calling us unsympathetic? You just threw a million-dollar party.
A tasteful Polynesian affair, culturally accurate, which I'm sure you would appreciate, and one that we can no longer pay for because this criminal has left us flat broke.
Also not true.
You have a large stake in a company called Pied Piper.
Yes, but I I can't sell my shares at Pied Piper.
Not now.
Wouldn't it cover your outstanding debts? Of course.
But they could potentially be worth billions.
Yes, and how do you see that playing to people who are being priced out of their homes by rich tech people? Have either of you been on a jury? No, of course not.
I always get out of it.
The fines are very reasonable.
You don't just throw those things away? Gentlemen, let me tell you what I see.
I see two able-bodied, entitled young white men who lucked into more money than most people see in five lifetimes, and who, if they hadn't had their millions stolen, would have promptly squandered them on more things like relocated swimming pools and lost tiki heads.
It's not lost.
I know exactly where it is.
It's in the bay.
And if your Coast Guard would be a little more helpful, we probably could have dragged it out of there by now.
Mr.
Bachmann, you pay those caterers and bartenders you owe money to or I assure you, that, I will prosecute.
Mr.
Chugtai, I am gonna need all the phone numbers of the people on your list.
Why? I'm just calling everybody that was on the beta and saying hi and a quick thank you, and then a just a couple of follow-up questions.
Yeah I don't think so.
What do what do you mean? Well, I mean, put yourself in their shoes.
They're, like, snowboarding in Tahoe or, like, banging some smokin' chick, and then this fuckin' nerd calls and he wants to talk about his app.
- Buzz-kill.
- Wait.
Your boys are where? Well, those are just hypotheticals.
I mean, my boys could be anywhere.
I don't keep track of my boys.
Actually, we can.
We have the IP address and GPS coordinates for every active user, so we can figure out just where your boys are at.
Um, you added a god-view? When did you do that? Right before I gave it to Tara.
I told you, trust no one.
Oh, that is very cool.
Nice work, Gilfoyle.
And we can isolate each of our users.
Dinesh's, for example Before we invade people's privacy, there is a conversation about ethics.
Why is it that five of your users show up at this address? Oh, it's buggy.
Should we beta test the god-view? I'm happy to drag this out as long as you want to.
Fine.
I was having trouble filling up my list, so I made up a few people.
Well, people do create imaginary friends to meet their emotional needs.
When I was little, I used to pretend that I shared a room with Harriet Tubman and we were always planning our big escape.
Wait.
Who is this, and why are they at the Hooli campus? What? Did you give the beta to someone at fucking Hooli? - Who's Max Karnow? - Oh! That's not one of my friends.
I have no friends.
Got him from Richard.
No.
No, th that can't be right.
MAN: I went to Hendricks' Facebook page.
I found a friend of his that lived near Palo Alto, searched his name and found that he was in the tech business.
I then came up with a great idea to dummy up an email account in his name, sent a beta request to Hendricks, and then voila.
- That's incredible.
- Yes, well, it is my craft.
You see, I think security detail is like creating great jazz where you can all What are you talk I'm talking about the beta.
Will you shut the fuck up?! - Ahem - Fuck, this is good.
Their sign-up flow, their mobile app, it's just seamless.
How are they doing this?! I can put a team on that, sir.
- If you want to know how they - Why are you so high-maintenance? - Do you want me to answer that, sir? - No! Goddamn it! You're so needy! Okay, I just talked to the real Max Karnow, and he had no idea about the beta.
Wow, um, clearly we're dealing with a Hooli spy here.
So what do we do? I mean, shut down his account, obviously.
Yeah.
On it.
Sorry, Dinesh.
You will now have one less fake friend.
Wait, Gilfoyle.
Is shutting down this guy's account really the worst thing we can think of to do to him? Oh, my God.
Where the fuck is my head? Stand by.
Look at their compression ratios.
The more files uploaded, the better they get? - Are we doing that? - No.
Not really.
That's gotta be some kind of machine learning optimization.
Maybe a neural net? Well, then I want that.
You need to put that into our platform.
Now.
I'm not even sure we have the resources here to engineer something like that.
And even if we did, our platform isn't designed to accommodate it.
You're talking about a ground-up rebuild.
Great.
So do that.
And beat them to market.
That's impossible.
You're at Hooli now, Marc.
In case you didn't know, here at Hooli, we make the impossible possible.
- So if I say I need - (COMPUTER PINGS) - What the fuck is happening? - MARC: Oh, shit! It looks like a zip bomb.
They must know it's us.
- That hard drive is fucked.
- This is my personal laptop.
You opened a stolen beta on your personal computer? Yes.
And I installed it on my phone.
Shit.
It could fry the entire system.
Cut the power to the building! No, Gavin.
It's isolated to your user account, so it's just your laptop and your phone.
It has no impact on the rest of the network.
You don't know that.
You don't know shit.
None of you do! You don't even know what Hendricks is capable of.
Cut the power to the building! Cut the power to the building! GILFOYLE: And that's that.
- And now delete user.
- RICHARD: Nice.
Wait, is that is that Monica? She finally opened it.
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's odd.
It says here that she started using it yesterday.
Wait, so she lied? Why would she lie about using the beta? Yeah, why would Dinesh lie about having friends? Why would Tara lie to me about fucking other guys when we have a totally open and hedonistic relationship that allows for behavior like that? Because people like to lie, Richard.
It's a war of all against all.
The history of humanity is a book written in blood.
We're all just animals in a pit.
- I feel very sad.
- Fucking Gilfoyle.
No, no.
What are you doing? Get back to work.
On what? You powered down all the computers.
Use a notepad.
Code on your phone.
We have a deadline here.
No, Gavin, you have a deadline.
We quit, like we should have done the first time.
What first time? What are you talking about? We both worked at Nucleus right here in this room.
Yeah, before you fired us and rehired us to do the exact same thing without ever noticing.
I invited you to my wedding, Gavin.
Why? We just lost our key engineers.
What the hell do we do now? No one leaves this room until we figure it out.
Thanks for the lift.
Steve's place is pretty far away from everything, but he's letting me stay on his couch for free, so And you were supposed to be my meal ticket.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.
- (PHONE CHIMES) Hold on.
CJ called.
CJ: Hey, uh, just wanted to let you know about a great new story I'm chasing.
It's a cautionary tale of two young entrepreneurs who flew too close to the sun.
I mean, apparently in the midst of losing millions, they threw a huge party they couldn't afford.
I talked to two bartenders and a caterer who worked your party the other night.
None of them have been paid.
Call me.
Well, it appears we spent our last dime acquiring a tech blog whose chief focus is chronicling our demise.
(SIGHS) And Jian-Yang JIAN-YANG: Erlich Bachmann, is your refrigerator running? This is Mike Hunt.
Oh, here, here it is on the right.
Thanks, man.
Hey, uh, are you sure you're cool with me taking both cannonballs? - I'm sure.
- Thanks, partner.
I got it.
- I know you lied.
- (COUGHS) - Sorry.
- What the fuck? - Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.
How the hell did you know that I was here? Well, we have god-view on the beta, and I saw you leave your office and come here.
So you're stalking me? Look, Monica, I know you're lying about not using the beta, so why haven't I heard from you? - Richard - No, it's okay.
If you don't like it, you can say it.
Everybody loves it, so I think I can handle one negative review.
- Fine.
I don't like it.
- Really? Are you serious? Everybody else loves it.
I've never wanted to like something more in my life, Richard.
- I just I don't.
- Okay.
What specifically do you not like about it? Specifically? All of it.
I mean, it's not, it's not the UX or the design or anything that you can tweak.
It's just the whole thing feels engineered.
Okay.
Well, that might make sense because, um, I'm an engineer.
Look, you've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback.
The build is incredibly stable, and you're out of money.
So if you think it's ready, you should launch and unlock the next three million.
Look, Monica, I I value your opinion, and you're the one that doesn't like it, so I don't know.
Richard, look - I passed on Slack.
- Really? I never told Laurie.
She'd probably fire me if she knew, but I had a chance to buy 20 percent of Slack for nothing, and I passed.
I didn't get it.
I still don't.
I mean, what is it? Is it email? Is it a chat room? Turns out the answer is it's a three billion dollar company.
But that's the fucked up thing about what we do.
Sometimes our opinion is wrong.
And no matter how good something is, there's always gonna be someone who doesn't get it.
And unfortunately, with Pied Piper, it's me.
Um, a week ago, I was worried about releasing a beta no one would like.
I'm just bummed that you're the one that doesn't like it.
Which is why you can't listen to anyone else.
If you believe in something, don't let anyone talk you out of it, including me.
Peter Gregory always said, Don't invest in products; invest in people.
I invested in you, and if you think it's ready to go, I will go to Laurie and fight like hell for it.
So, what do you want to do? LAURIE: Congratulations, everyone.
Yeah, I can't believe it.
We're actually, finally, launching.
Yes.
Tuesday, 9:00 a.
m.
Pats on the back.
Pats on the back.
Gentlemen, I just realized I've forgotten to take a shit.
So, uh, I'll see you back at the old homestead.
Okay.
Laurie.
I have a business proposition I'd like to discuss with you.
It's about my shares in Pied Piper.
Okay, T minus five minutes.
Dinesh, are you still seriously squashing bugs? Not really.
I'm so fucking tired, I'm creating more than I'm fixing.
Where the fuck is Gilfoyle? This isn't easy for me to do.
You served me well, old friend.
But we're transferring to AWS now, and I'm afraid you can't come.
Oh, I'm pathetic? I'd rather have a bunch of fake friends than be best friends with a fucking metal box.
Can't you two see? You're each other's best friends.
BOTH: Fuck you, Jared.
Yeah.
Jinx.
You owe each other a friendship.
DINESH: One minute.
Holy shit.
- Holy shit.
- (PHONE RINGS) Excuse me.
- Hello? - Hey, it's CJ.
Uh, I just heard from the folks that worked your party.
And? And it turns out they were paid in full.
So apparently I owe you an apology, and I feel bad.
Not as bad as I feel, I can assure you.
- (PHONE BEEPS) - Yeah, I'm getting another call.
Hello? JIAN-YANG: Erlich Bachmann, this is your mom, and you are not my baby.
Not now, Jian-Yang! Not now! Go back into your room! - Sorry.
- It's okay.
Here we are, Erlich.
Jobs and Woz, Woz and Jobs.
I mean, we did it.
You and me, man, forever.
(LAUGHS) All right.
Richard, never been more excited to be proven wrong.
Yeah, well, get ready for your lives to change forever.
Five ALL: four, three, two, one.




******************************************
N/A - Bachman's Earning's Over-Ride
1 From "Bloomberg West" in San Francisco, I'm Emily Chang.
General Keith Alexander is here to tackle tech's role in counter-terrorism, but first, a quick glimpse with Richard Hendricks, founder and CEO of the hot new compression platform Pied Piper, and Erlich Bachman, Chief Visionary.
Oh, Emily Chang, it is just splendid to be here with you, at historical Pier Three, with a breathtaking view of the (SPANISH ACCENT) Embarcadero Center and the flag of (SPANISH ACCENT) San Francisco.
Now, Richard Richard actually developed this technology in my incubator.
I am listed-- I was originally listed under the white pages as "Erlich Blachman," uh, with an "L," a typo that apparently couldn't be changed, and then Google indexed it, so I've been dealing with that.
Richard, Pied Piper has taken off like a rocket.
More than a hundred thousand installs in just ten days.
Is that right? Uh uh, yes.
Pretty amazing.
And you have a last-minute invite to the "Vanity Fair" Summit dinner tonight.
Quite an honor for such a young company.
Richard, maybe you can comment on this one? Yeah, we are the-- finally the-- the belles of the balls.
(LAUGHS) I mean, uh, ball.
Now, some people are calling you the next unicorn.
Have you guys thought about that? You could have a billion-dollar company.
Erlich, you could own five percent of a billion dollars.
Uh, ten, actually.
ERLICH: Richard, this is boring.
- Shit.
- RICHARD: No, no, no.
He was-- he was an early investor.
Again, it's Erlich Bachman.
If you Google that, it'll say, "Did you mean Erlich Blachman?" You can click on that link, it'll give you the correct results for Erlich Bachman.
Should we take some calls? We don't do that here.
I just know what I saw, Richard.
No, come on.
Look, she's married, she just had another baby.
If you pushed a little harder, you could have scored right there on camera.
- You should get her phone number.
- Shut up.
(PHONE RINGS) Oh.
This is actually, uh, Jian-Yang pranking me.
I should take it.
Yes, of course I have frog's legs.
Why do you ask? Are you serious? Have you honestly still not told him that you sold your shares? You can't keep lying to him like this.
It's not technically a lie.
My shares don't transfer to Raviga until the next board meeting.
Come on, it's been ten days.
I know, I know, but, you know, the TechCrunch thing came up and then there was the Reddit AMA and, you know, now this Bloomberg thing.
And besides, let's be honest, Richard shouldn't be in the public eye without me along to help.
Did you see the skeeved-out look on Emily Chang's face? I thought she was going to walk off set.
Erlich, you're lying to him, and you made me a part of it, so now I'm lying to him, too.
The longer you wait, the worse this is gonna get.
- All right, fine, I'll tell him.
- When? After the "Vanity Fair" thing tonight.
I mean, did you see the guest list? Monica, throw me a bone here.
24 hours, then I'm telling him.
- Fine, I'll tell him.
I'll tell Richard.
- MONICA: I'm serious.
- Tell me what? - MONICA: I'm not joking-- Um, it was, uh, Jian-Yang.
He said to tell you that Phillip McCrevis left word.
Oh, who's "Fill-up My--" Oh.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYS) Richard, we'd better get our asses in first fucking gear if we want to make it to this "Verge" photoshoot.
Oh, shit.
That's today? Yes, I assumed that's why you're still - wearing your Bloomberg makeup.
- No.
No, I was just-- I kind of like the way it-- can we just push this to next week, please? They don't really do that.
Okay, well, can you go? Please? I just have a ton of work, and honestly I would be really happy if I never had to do any of this ever again and then you were just the face of the company.
You know what I mean? Oh, shit.
What-- what time is this "Vanity Fair" thing? It's tonight.
I figure we're wheels up by 6:00, then we can check into the hotel, shit, shave and shit again.
- Get a cocktail.
- What hotel? Eavesdropping.
Well, if you must know, we got a suite at the Fairmont, and they're sending a car.
I think Richard deserves it.
And then I figured tomorrow in the a.
m.
, we would sleep in and have a nice brunch.
I don't have time for a brunch.
I have to be back here.
Come on, eggs benny, a little spinach tartar, you'll flirt with the waitress.
Killer.
And, uh, we'll have a nice talk.
- Talk? What about? - You know, things, all sorts of themes.
So tomorrow, you, me, brunch and, uh, one word frittata.
Hey, fellas, is it me or is it a bit chilly in here? (CHUCKLES) What in God's name is that? What do you think it is? It's a jacket! (LAUGHS) Now, I only ordered one as a sample, but once I have your sizes, we can all have them.
Why would we all want them? One is already too many.
I don't mean in the house.
I mean, like, in the world.
Now Gilfoyle, I have you at about a 40 long? Am I right? If my mother was naked and dead in the street, I would not cover her body with that jacket.
(LAUGHS) Gilf.
Jared, now that you're here, we need two new tables in the game room.
Yeah? Okay.
Well, maybe against the doors? Oh, hold on, there's more.
"PIED PIPER: Because 'awesome world-changing compression company' would take up too much space.
" And you guys give me shit for a tiny gold chain? I regret nothing.
I'm going to get coffee.
Hey, Brownie, you coming? I was thinking we'd hit the Philz on Middlefield.
No, let's drive to the one on Forest Avenue.
It's further from that jacket.
Claude, you're on pager duty until we get back.
Jared, can I borrow that jacket? I sense you're doing something ironic with it, but I'm okay with that because however unattractive this jacket may seem to you, once you slip it on, everything will change.
It'll shake out its hair and take off its glasses, and before you know it, you'll be in love.
Jared, it's really fucking ugly.
GAVIN: Consider the tortoise.
As the fable teaches us, it may appear that he is losing in his race against his nemesis, the insolent and cocksure hare.
But appearances can be deceiving.
Gavin, the tortoise.
Is it Endframe? Yes.
But there's more.
The hare is Pied Piper.
Indeed it is.
Someone's read their Aesop.
We've also read the financials, Gavin.
Between Nucleus and Endframe, you've burned through three-quarters of a billion dollars, with virtually nothing to show for it.
Two weeks ago, on the heels of powering down the entire Hooli campus for seemingly no reason, you lost all of Endframe's senior engineers.
I grant you, we've stumbled on offense of late, but the best offense is a good defense.
We've taken a page out of Apple's playbook and are currently "reviewing" the Pied Piper app for sale in our Hooli store at a pace one might call "tortoise-like.
" Don't.
They hate that.
In any case, I have it on good authority that it may be some time before Pied Piper is available on Hooli OS devices.
- We're making it available immediately.
- Sorry? You're fighting a war that's already ended, Gavin.
Pied Piper won.
We called this board meeting to inform you that it's time for Hooli to let go and move on without you at the wheel.
I'm sorry, without me? (LAUGHS) Are you firing me? Our intention is simply to transition you into a more appropriate role within the company, one with less oversight of day-to-day operations.
You're putting me on the fucking roof? You could always choose to move on, Gavin.
Up to you.
I built this company with my bare hands in my fucking garage.
Where were you when I was doing that? Gavin? These animals? Fuck.
Well, uh, you are certainly more than qualified to be our new head of PR.
Laurie thinks you're great.
Um, to be honest, we could use the help.
All the media stuff has been pretty overwhelming, especially lately.
- If Marissa Mayer can do it, so can you.
- Oh.
(CHUCKLES) And, uh, you're available immediately? I am.
I do have one question for you guys.
Is everything here cool? Is it cool? Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I mean, I'm-- I'm cool.
- Yeah, he is cool.
- Uh-huh.
Clearly, but is there anything you guys want to tell me about the company? What, like, uh-- All right, look, this is weird, but when I was in Laurie's office yesterday, I saw a piece of paper on her desk.
Well, she-- she can be a bit untidy.
It was a sale of a big block of Pied Piper stock.
Is someone on the inside dumping shares right as you're launching? What? No.
No, absolutely not.
'Cause that would be a pretty severe signaling risk.
I mean, you don't have to be in PR to know that insiders only dump stock like that when they know something is wrong.
The bulk of my compensation here would be options, and if those aren't going to be worth anything-- Yeah.
No.
No, no, no.
That is not happening, okay? Nothing is going on here.
- Yeah, except excellence.
- Okay.
Well, you let me know what you want to do and I'll think about it.
Okay.
Oh.
Um, well, thanks for coming.
What the hell was that? Maybe it was a negotiating tactic? Monica.
It's Monica.
Well, let's not jump to conclusions.
I mean, she's the only one who's bought a jacket.
Jared, she's the only one who hates the platform.
There's no other explanation for this.
Okay? Monica fucked us.
She pulled down her pants and fucked us in front of her parents.
Did some-- Richard, did somebody do that to you? No.
No, I don't know why-- Oh, boy, it is chilly.
Good thing I brought this sweet jiz-acket.
Eh, friend? We came here together.
I know what you're doing.
You think you're embarrassing me, but that's only the secondary effect of that shitty jacket.
The primary effect is (EMPHATICALLY) that you look like a douchebag.
Let me put this in terms you'll understand.
I'm like a suicide bomber of humiliation.
I'm happy to go out as long as I take you with me.
Your shame is my paradise.
(CLEARS THROAT) S'up, ladies? What you noshing on? Cranberry scone? My friend Dinesh here has a little crush on you.
He's shy.
I don't know him.
Oh, he plays coy.
I don't know why he's so shy.
Excuse me.
I noticed your jacket.
Do you work for Pied Piper? - Yeah.
- Dude, your app is killin' it.
Everyone I know is installing it.
Do you seriously? I just downloaded it last night.
Yeah? Do you mind if we get a picture? - With me? - GIRL: Yeah.
Everybody get in.
If you want it.
(PHONE CAMERAS CLICKING) - Thanks.
- MAN: Thanks, bro.
Hey, man, did you remember to put money in the meter? Hi, I'm Dinesh.
I work at Pied Piper.
Excuse me, do I know you? Gilfoyle.
He's a fuckin' dick, but I love him, though.
You have me confused with someone else.
My name's clearly Jared, and if you would excuse us, you were interrupting.
No, he's lying.
His name is Gilfoyle.
Show them your driver's license.
Jared asked you nicely to step back, so step the fuck back.
You're being a dick, and you're cutting in line.
You heard him.
You're being a dick.
(MOUTHS) - Boy, some people.
- WOMAN: What a creep.
MAN: Sorry you had to deal with that, Jared.
GILFOYLE: You and me both, friend.
- (PHONE RINGS) - This is Monica.
Is it? Because apparently everything else that comes out of your mouth is a lie.
Shit.
Look, Richard, I totally understand if you're pissed at me, but please know that I tried as hard as I could to get him to tell you.
Oh, really? Well, that's not what he said.
Oh, really? What exactly did he say? He said that he found it on a piece of paper in Laurie's office.
What? Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
Who's the "he" that you're talking about? You know who.
David.
- My brother? - What? Who the fuck-- I don't know.
(LAUGHS) No, David, the fucking PR guy who's not going to take a job with us because of what you did.
Richard, I am totally lost.
What exactly do you think I did? You can play dumb all you want to.
It won't change the one thing that both you and I know is true.
You dumped your stock.
What? No.
I didn't dump a single share of my Pied Piper stock.
I swear.
Well, then who the fuck did? - - And make sure that the money reads.
I mean, Pied Piper is a billion-dollar company.
It's not just a unicorn.
All right, let's do some rearing.
There we go.
Now, let's let the horns sort of look like my dick.
Perfect.
- Are you fucking kidding me? - Richard.
Um, can we take a soft five? I was going to tell you.
That's what tomorrow's brunch was for.
Brunch? You had ten fucking days and you didn't say a thing.
Fine.
You want to know why I didn't tell you? Because it's fucking humiliating.
I'm broke, Richard.
Did you hear me? I'm broke.
Erlich Bachman, the name that used to be synonymous with success, went broke and was forced to sell.
- I got royally fucked, Richard.
- You got fucked? You're the one who threw a million-dollar party.
- Yeah, but it was a great party.
- No one forced you to do that.
Admit it, you fucked yourself.
But I'm not gonna let you fuck my company.
I'm going to have to issue a press release explaining what you did and why.
No, no, come on.
This isn't out.
- It's one PR guy.
- That we know of, Erlich.
How many other people saw that piece of paper? How many people has this guy talked to? This is Silicon Valley.
Rumors spread like light speed here.
How are we gonna get good people to work for us if they think something funky is going on with our stock? How are we going to scale? This is going to kill us.
Richard, do you know what happens if this goes public? - I'm Ron Wayne.
- Who? Ron Wayne.
The guy that owned ten percent of Apple and sold it in 1976.
No one in this town will work with me ever again.
You want me to risk the entire future of Pied Piper, everything that I've worked for, just to protect you from your own fucking incompetence? Richard, there's a three to four percent chance that this is going to get out on its own, but there is 100 percent chance that if you issue a press release no one will ever take me seriously again.
My dignity is in your hands, Richard.
Do with it what you will.
Gavin? Is that you? - Jack Barker.
- Nice plane.
- Yours too.
- Where are you headed? I just needed to take a walk and clear my head.
There's this great little hiking trail near my lodge in Jackson Hole.
Get out of here.
I'm on my way up to J Hole myself.
Is that right? I thought you sold.
No, I just never go there.
So how long you going for? Coming back tomorrow afternoon.
- Me, too.
- Oh, come on.
Come on.
Seriously, we need to find a couple hours, get together, catch up.
I could tell you some war stories.
Well, I'd love that.
I could tell you a few of my own.
(LAUGHS) Well, be well.
- You, too.
- Take care, Jack.
- Yeah.
- See you.
Gavin? Wait.
Uh, what are we doing here? I mean, you're on your way to Jackson Hole, I'm going to Jackson Hole.
You seem like you could use some company.
- You play chess? - I do.
Indeed.
Fantastic.
I tell you, when we get up to altitude and the Wi-Fi kicks in, I'm ActionJB62 on Hooli chat.
- Find me.
- I will.
- I'm glad we bumped into each other.
- Me, too.
- Really is a small world.
- It's crazy.
(BOTH LAUGH) Okay, well, uh, I think it reads well.
And it's all in there.
This will definitely set the record straight.
Then again, you're basically lighting Erlich on fire.
So what? He fucked the company.
He potentially fucked the company.
Are you kidding me? Wh-- Gilfoyle, back me up here.
This is thorny.
How is this even a question for you guys? Honestly? I mean, it's not like he's going to be out on the street.
He just sold ten percent of a company that's valued at at least 50 million dollars and now suddenly we're giving him the benefit of the doubt? Well, it sounds mighty Christian of you, Gilfoyle.
There's no reason for hate speech, Richard.
I can see by the sour, pinched expressions on all your faces that Richard has filled you in regarding the unfortunate circumstances that have forced me to relinquish my stake in your fair company.
Erlich, uh, you should know that I have written a press release.
- Oh? - I'm not going to release it yet, but if I hear wind of these rumors spreading out of control, I'm going to send it to every tech publication and blog on the face of the earth.
Do you understand? - Even UPROXX? - Yes, even them.
Also, uh this is the check for next month's use of the house as our office, but we'll be out by the end of the month.
Richard, it doesn't have to be like this.
From this point forward, you will have nothing to do with this company whatsoever.
I'm replacing you on the board, and I'm giving your seat to Jared.
- So that's it then.
- Yes.
So I guess we better get ready for that "Vanity Fair" event.
What? Did you not listen to a word I just said? I heard thousands of words about rumors and the need to contain them.
What do you think would happen if I didn't show up to this "Vanity Fair" event? I've already RSVP'd and given them a list of phony dietary restrictions just to cause a scene.
I told them I was pesca-pescatarian.
Which is one who eats solely fish who eat other fish.
I think my absence would be noted.
- Erlich brings up a good point.
- It's true.
Let us not forget Meinertzhagen's Havers-- Yes, yes, Meinertzhagen's Haversack.
We all remember his sack.
(SIGHS) Okay, fine.
Yeah.
Sure.
You can come.
I can't stop you.
Uh, I'll be taking the car and the hotel room and you're going to have to drive yourself.
Consider it my farewell dinner.
See you at the event.
(GASPING) - Jared, are you okay? - It's just so many emotions.
The board seat.
I feel regret and glee that you would choose to honor me, and terror at not living up to your expectations, and compassion for Erlich's loss.
Oh, Donald, you've come undone.
(CHUCKLES SADLY) You still want him on the board? Hi, there.
Checking in.
Richard Hendricks.
Fuck me.
Hey, Richie.
Oh, God.
Hey, Russ.
What's up, boy genius? You here fucking? Huh? No.
No, no, no fucking.
Just, uh, here for the "Vanity Fair" dinner.
Oh, yeah, I know that stupid dinner.
Bunch of VC douchebags jerking each other off.
Speaking of, I got this girl at the bar, I'm trying to take her up to the presidential suite before her fucking bridesmaids ruin the whole thing, but they're telling me it's booked.
Who is it? Is it Gore? Fuck that guy.
- Oh, God.
- I saw Pied Piper launched.
Haven't tried it, probably won't.
I don't even want to think about how fucked I got missing out on Erlich's shares.
Fuck.
Wait, he-- he tried to sell you his shares? Well, half of them.
He was pretty desperate to stay on the team.
Well, he didn't mention anything about this to me.
Of course not.
Why would he? It's fucking humiliating losing all your money.
You think when I dropped below a billion I walked around telling everybody? Fuck no.
You guys were the only ones who knew, and I actually thought about having you killed.
- I'm sorry, what? - So Erlich and I, like two weeks ago, we had a contract ready five mil I was gonna pay him for half his shares.
It was a win-win.
Then that robot, Laurie Bream, sweeps in and cockblocks the whole thing.
She forces him to sell her all his shares.
You think she's gay? Maybe.
It hasn't come up.
I, uh-- so wait, she outbid you? Outbid me? No, she didn't have to.
You don't even know how your own fucking company works? (LAUGHS) All right, Mr.
Hendricks, we have you staying one night - in a deluxe double.
- Okay, do you have a tub in that room? Does he have a tub in that room? I don't know.
There's no way of telling.
You know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna take her to the "W.
" She's so drunk she won't know the difference.
See you around, Richie.
(PHONE CHIMES) CJ ON VOICEMAIL: Hey, it's CJ.
Listen, I'm hearing a rumor about some serious ugliness going on at Pied Piper.
I've heard it from three different people now.
You need to call me.
Fuck.
LAURIE: What in God's name is the reason to get a higher education? You can just buy a megafreeze for 35 cents.
Laurie, can I talk to you for a second? Yes, uh, Richard Hendricks, - do you know Mark Pincus? - Hello.
- Big fan.
- Oh, okay.
Yes.
- Sorry, just one second.
- Yes.
Oh, all right.
I'm sorry to cut away like this.
We can continue discussing this.
Okay, uh, look, I know Erlich sold you all of his shares.
I'm just, uh, wondering exactly how that happened.
Ah, yes.
It was one of my finer moments.
Erlich came to me with an outside offer to sell half of his Pied Piper shares.
To Russ Hanneman for five million dollars.
Yes, I know.
But somehow you ended up with all of his shares.
How? Oh, well, as you know, the same onerous terms you accepted when you took Russ Hanneman's money, they transferred to me when I bought him out.
These included the right to block any transfer of stocks with a majority vote of the board.
A board which I control.
- I don't understand.
- Of course you do.
If I have approval of any buyer, and I am the only buyer I approve, then I can set my own price.
So I asked Mr.
Bachman for a thorough accounting of his debts, uh, which ran to approximately $713,000.
And how much did you give him? $713,000.
Jesus.
So, he walked away with nothing.
Uh, yes.
And so as I said, you're the one who accepted these terms, so you're the one who enabled this action on my part.
All credit goes to you, Richard.
Excuse me.
Dick.
Dick Costolo.
One moment.
I need to speak with you.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: It's expensive to re-plant.
No.
The vines are bad.
The soil is bad.
(CONVERSATION CONTINUES) Excuse me, what is that? That's pesca-pescatarian.
- It's fish that-- - Actually, just bring me one of those.
- Me, too.
- Yeah, waiter, I'll take on, too.
- I want one.
- MAN: I want one of those also.
MAN 2: Wait, hey, hey, I'd like that also.
MAN 3: Excuse me, if he's having one, I want one.
MAN 4: You're getting that, I want it, too.
Excuse me! Hey, I thought you were at the dinner.
I left.
Erlich never showed.
Is he here? Yeah.
He's hiding in the backyard.
- Why? - Have you not seen the article? No.
"Is Erlich Bachman the Dumbest Man in Tech?" What the hell is this? I never sent anything out.
- Who did they talk to? - Erlich.
This is CJ's blog.
He outed himself to protect Pied Piper.
This is way harsher than anything you ever wrote.
Plus, there's the visual component.
Speaking of where's your jacket, Jared? (CLEARS THROAT) That's quite a piece.
Informative.
Thorough.
You certainly know how to make an impact.
And I guess I don't have to worry about any rumors coming out.
Those are handled.
You know, Erlich, uh, Pied Piper still needs a head of PR.
You seem to be well-versed in media outreach.
And by your own admission in that article, your head is-- what did you say? --so far up your own ass you can see the future.
And that could be useful if we need a pre-cog (STAMMERS) in a way? Uh, I don't know if you're available, so Are you offering me a job? Well, we have a good option package.
Um, it won't be quite what you had, but it's something.
That's very generous.
So things could go back to the way they were before.
Well, no.
No.
Not exactly the way they were.
No, no.
Uh, well, this would be an actual job and you would have responsibilities.
Would this job have a title? Something, say, Chief Evangelism Officer? So, CEO? - JARED: Oh, my goodness! - What the fuck was that? Richard.
The Pied Piper app just got accepted to the Hooli store.
What? Holy shit.
Gavin Belson just presented us with his bare buttocks in submission.
(LAUGHS) We beat him.
I don't-- I don't hug.
No.
Um, okay, hey, look, uh, time to issue your first press release, right? It's very late, Richard, and I'm very high.
Erlich, I don't care.
You have to do it, okay? Now.
- It's your job.
- Okay.
- All right.
- Oh! - (JARED LAUGHS) - (DOOR CLOSES) CJ Cantwell.
Erlich Bachman.
The reason I'm calling has absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the fact that I own half of your blog and everything to do with the fact that I was just named Chief Evangelism Officer of Pied Piper.
Feel free to abbreviate that, whatever acronym is most economical.
And I have a story.
Well, if it's anything like this last one, I am all for it.
I am getting so many paid views on your tell-all.
Everyone in the Valley is reading it.
Well, that's good for you at my expense, I guess.
Anyway, I had no choice.
As you said, it was going to come out one way or another.
Why? No one knew about any of it until you told me.
What do you mean? You said that you had heard from a bunch of people that there are all these rumors about ugly shit going down at Pied Piper.
That's literally the only reason that I told you any of this.
What? Oh, yeah, three different people told me that Pied Piper had the ugliest jackets they'd ever seen.
Jackets? I was going to do, like, a whole swag fail thing, you know.
That could have been cool, no? Who the fuck cares about jackets? Hey, come on, babe Follow me I'm the Pied Piper Follow me, I'm the Pied Piper And I'll show you where it's at (SONG CONTINUES) Come on, babe can't you see? I'm the Pied Piper, trust in me I'm the Pied Piper And I'll show you where it's at Girl, don't be scared to move Hey, babe, what are you tryin' to prove? It ain't true that your life has kicked you It's your mind and that's all that's trickin' you So step in line Hey, come on, babe, follow me I'm the Pied Piper, follow me I'm the Pied Piper And I'll show you where it's at Come on, babe, can't you see? Come on, babe, follow me I'm the Pied Piper

N/A - Daily Active Users

1 FEMALE NARRATOR: Tables.
Tables are made so a person can sit down and do something.
Or nothing.
Any person can sit at a table, and if the table is large enough, many people.
To make jokes, eat a meal, tell stories.
Tables are for people to be together and share.
And that is why tables are like Pied Piper.
Grapefruits, postcards, hugs.
These are things people share to connect, to come closer.
To open up about ideas and things that make us feel alive, like air, ballet, amazing haircuts, weird countries, three-alarm chili, mountains, continents, the Earth, life.
Life is beautiful and sad and hopeful and dangerous.
So maybe the reason we share so much is because we understand that without sharing, we can't survive.
And sharing is tables.
(WHISPERS) Pied Piper.
Yes.
Tables.
I see.
It's a metaphor.
- It's a wonderful ad spot.
- Yeah.
We're all just tables.
I love what you've done with the place.
It's a really nicely done place.
Say, is that your dog? It's a dog.
You and I have never really had much of a rapport, have we? It's wanting.
Oh, look.
Well, we're almost there.
Prepare to gather, everyone.
No, I didn't say to gather.
I simply said prepare to gather.
- RICHARD: Monica, hey.
- Oh, hey.
How's it going? - You holding up okay? - Not really.
I know.
Her parties are always deeply weird.
Hey, um, I guess this is as good a time as any to say it, but, um, I'm really sorry for not getting Pied Piper.
And to be honest, it's really embarrassing to be so fucking wrong.
Well, here's the thing, you, uh, you might not be.
What? What are you talking about? Uh okay.
So, well, Pied Piper launches and everything's great, and we spent a fucking bazillion dollars, on the Tables ad and now we are almost at 500,000 installs, right? - Yeah.
What's the problem? - Well, as you know, installs isn't really the metric that matters.
We need daily active users, people who come back to the platform.
Okay, so how many daily users do you actually have? Okay, what would what would be a number that would make you say, "Ugh, oh, that's bad.
" I don't know, like, 100,000? - Oh.
- Are you less? How much less? - 19,000.
- 19 19,000 less than a hu - 81,000? - No.
No, just 19,000.
- That's the only number.
- What? - That's that's terrible.
- Yeah.
I'm aware.
- Well, yeah, that's art, not a chair.
- Oh.
Richard! Oh, my well, you haven't told Laurie yet, have you? - No.
- Okay.
Well, who else knows? - Dinesh and Gilfoyle? - No.
- Erlich? - (ERLICH LAUGHS) No.
MONICA: Well, apparently Jared knows.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah, Pied Piper's sort of what I'm known for, but I'm into a lot of cool stuff.
Like, a lot.
You seem surprised.
I'll give you an example.
A few months ago, I'm at my computer, freestyling, just kind of jammin' out, you know, before I knew it I had thrown together the greatest video-chat app the world has ever seen.
So you invented Skype a few months ago? Great ideas just sort of flow through me.
The platform, you know, it's sort of a group project, but, uh, the video-chat app, that's my solo album.
- Oh, Robert.
- I'm Dinesh.
What the fuck is going on with you? Hmm? Could you be more specific? You're hiding something.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) What? No, I'm not.
Everything's fine.
You know, everything's fine.
That's a lie.
I can tell because you subscribe to traditional Judeo-Christian mores of right and wrong.
You're made uncomfortable by untruth.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) My commitment to LaVeyan Satanism grants me certain freedoms.
There is no good and evil, there's only self.
- Would you like a beverage? - Yes, I would.
Lie.
You just want me to go to the bar and leave you alone.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY, COUGHS) Gil you crack me up.
- Lie.
- (CHUCKLES) I terrify you, as I should.
(LAUGHS) Get out of here.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so, I just spoke with my friend who runs a market research firm, she's gonna set up a focus group for the platform, put it in the hands of some real users, and hopefully it'll be super obvious what's going wrong.
- Okay, great.
- Clink, clink, clink.
Gather.
Faster, please.
Gather faster.
We're close.
We need to see the numbers change.
ALL: 499,995, 499,996 499,997 (CHEERING) It's going great.
Uh, they've been engaging with the platform for about an hour now.
- They're just starting the Q and A.
- RICHARD: Uh, great.
Thank you, everyone, for sharing your feelings on the revolutionary new Pied Piper platform.
Now, Bernice, you say here that you were totally freaked out by the platform.
What specifically totally freaked you out? Everything.
Just every single thing about it.
Just, like, how it worked.
MAN: Now, who else found themselves totally freaked out by this platform? Barry, Warren, Natalie, Martina, Gwen, Amy, Walker, and Clay.
You were all totally freaked out.
Was anyone not totally freaked out? Clark? Good.
What was your reaction? It just made me feel stupid.
This file sync thing is confusing.
When I put videos into my main folder, it says it uploaded them, but then I didn't see where they went.
It said stuff was on my phone and my iPad, but when I looked at the memory, it said, zero K used, so stuff wasn't on there.
That's the platform.
He's describing the platform and what's great about it.
Well, clearly he doesn't get it.
clearly none of these people get it.
Maybe this is a bad group.
This is the fifth one today and it's the least hostile reaction we've seen.
Okay, well, everyone that I showed the beta to loved it.
Loved.
- Oh, shit.
- What? Who did you give the beta to? - Your friends.
Engineers.
- Well, yeah, Monica.
I wanted to give it to people who would understand what I'm trying to do, so I could get useful feedback.
And with all due respect, I gave it to you, the one person without a computing background, and you said it felt engineered.
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.
You're trying to sell the platform to regular people, but you never actually put it in the hands of regular people.
Like them.
Shouldn't there be a download button? Did they honestly forget to add a download button? You know what, Richard, why don't we just go I mean, who designed this thing? I did.
I designed it.
Excuse me? Who are you? Uh, my name is Richard Hendricks, I'm the CEO of Pied Piper.
Oh, my God.
Oh, you're the one who forgot the download button.
Yes.
But no.
No, actually, there is no download button because, um, well, you don't need a download button.
We're past that.
I mean, that's the old thing.
This guy, actually, he should have told you that.
I'm a moderator, not an advocate.
Okay, well, with Pied Piper, you don't need to download anything or send anything at all, anywhere, because the second you take a photo or a video or compose a text message, it's on all of your devices instantly.
- So it's all on my phone? - Yes.
Wrong! It says "zero K used," so it's not on there.
Aha! (CHUCKLES) Aha Yes, well, that's the best part about the platform right there.
Yes, uh, because you're right, it's not actually on the phone.
But you don't need it to be on the phone if you can see it on the phone, even though there's nothing there at all.
But where the hell is it? Everywhere.
And nowhere, sort of.
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Let me, uh, let me just take a step back here and explain it in a simpler way.
- Um, sorry, what was your name? - Bernice.
Bernice.
What did you have for breakfast today? - Scrambled eggs.
- Scrambled eggs.
And what's in the eggs? Electrons.
Right? And we all know how electrons exist in orbitals.
Multivalent states? No? No one knows this? Okay.
Okay, that's fine.
Bad example.
That's on me.
I'll I'm going to use the whiteboard here.
You're gonna you're gonna love this.
Okay.
Then, once we hit a critical mass of users, the volume of data moving through the system will enable the neural net to start optimizing the platform.
It will actually get smarter and faster all on its own.
Is that like when I'm texting and my phone starts guessing what I'm going to say? This goes way beyond autocomplete.
Actually, all of your devices will begin helping each other in ways that we can't even design or predict.
Okay, but see, the problem is Terminator.
What? No.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No.
I can assure there is no Skynet type of situation here.
No.
Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world.
He just told us he couldn't predict it.
I'm just saying everybody died.
- ALL: Mm-hm, yeah.
- RICHARD: You're right.
In those movies, there were a lot of casualties.
- Quite scary to think.
- It's food for thought.
Speaking of Can we order some pizzas in here? So, when we put our files into a Pied Piper folder, they get split up into tiny bits and spread across a network of other users' devices? Yes, that's, uh, peer-to-peer distribution.
Continue.
But they can't look at any of our files because they only have tiny, scrambled pieces of them? - Encrypted sharding.
- Clark with the assist.
Great.
Uh, go on.
But we can look at any of our files anytime, anywhere even though they're not actually on any of our devices.
Yes.
Yes, Bernice, that's it.
That's Pied Piper.
That's everything.
So it's all on our phones even though it sort of isn't.
Oh, my God.
That's awesome.
Isn't it? Yeah.
So, uh, what do you think? Will you use Pied Piper now? - Well, yeah, I think I will.
- Me, too, - now that you've explained how it works.
- There you go.
That's what we've been aiming for.
RICHARD: They get it! What's he smiling at? This data was corrupted the second he walked in that room.
So we're tanking, and it's because we're too good.
That's one way of looking at it.
Uh, yes.
Yes, we have created a product so far ahead of its time, people are having difficulty wrapping their heads around it.
Well, then we just need to change the platform, right? - We simplify it.
- RICHARD: Well, we can't.
It's not as if I don't want to, it's just that we literally can't do it.
Um, if you build an airplane and people are afraid of anything that flies, you can't just take the wings off of it, because, at that point, all you're left with is a really slow, super expensive shitty bus.
No, uh, we built an airplane, we got to fly it.
What's the point of flying if it's fucking empty? I think people will want to fly once they realize how cool the platform is.
Guys, I know we're in a tough spot right now, and I know we needed a quarter million DAU's in order to get our next round of funding, but this is it.
I think we can do this.
All we got to do is just take every last dollar that we have, which is, uh Sorry, uh, Jared, what? Well, after the Table ads, the salaries, recruiter fees You know what? I haven't run the numbers.
It would be irresponsible to estimate.
Okay, uh, is it less than a million dollars? - Oh, God, yeah.
- Okay.
- It's higher than 500,000, right? - Yeah.
I guess it's about $697,240.
But don't quote me on that.
Okay, we use that money to do outreach, tutorials, user meetups, uh, create a guerrilla marketing campaign that explains how cool the platform is.
I know it's not ideal, but, um, I really think we can pull this off.
Yeah, that seems doable.
Lie.
Or here's another idea.
We could put the platform on hold, take the money we have left and pivot to something that doesn't require hours of explanation.
You know, I've been showing people the video-chat app - that I hacked together and - Shut up, Dinesh! You ungrateful pricks, all of you.
Your tepid response to our intrepid boss makes me ill.
His plan, will it work? Mm-mm.
Almost certainly not.
All of you will likely look back at this time in your lives and realize you wasted a whole year with nothing to show for it.
But if this company is a plane, then this is Richard's goddamn plane, and if he wants to fly it in the side of a fucking mountain, that is his prerogative and it is our duty to climb on, strap in and have a fiery death right behind him.
RICHARD: I don't I don't know about that, but Richard, the floor.
Crashing aside, I think this is the plan and, uh, really, what other option do we have? Well, I know what option I have.
I can quit.
So I quit.
Okay.
Any anybody else? Guys, no.
Look, Douglas, customer support is going to be a big part of this.
We need you guys if we're going to get 250,000 users.
I barely have any customers to support, Richard.
And the only way you're going to get that many users is if you go to one of those click farms in Bangladesh and pay for them.
Good fuckin' luck, man.
I'm out.
- Guys, wait.
- Jared, let them go.
I have to do their exit interviews.
I guess I can do them on their walk to their cars.
Richard, we're better off without them.
Lie.
This is intolerable.
A man can only take so much.
Banished from my own company? No.
I'm just going to give them what they want.
I'm going to resign.
We can go to Haiti, build orphanages.
Haiti? Is it not said that one should think globally and act locally? I'm not acting at all.
Lao Tzu teaches the best fighter is never angry.
More important than the blow is knowing when to strike.
Like, perhaps, after we experience the executive white water rafting trip in Coeur D'Alene? Gavin, do you have a moment? Yes.
Alone? Of course.
Denpok? What? Give us a moment, please? Gavin, I'm really not supposed to be talking to you, but there's something I think you should know about.
I'm listening.
A customer service rep that just left Pied Piper is on campus right now interviewing for a job.
Why would anyone leave Pied Piper now? I thought maybe you'd want to ask him yourself.
Well done.
Well done.
Okay.
Thank you for coming in, Douglas.
- Yeah.
- Right this way.
Okay.
- Uh - Douglas.
Consider the possum.
Nature's Gavin, if you're bringing another animal into this board room, - this meeting is over.
- Of course not.
Don't insult me.
Gentlemen and lady of the Hooli board, I am the possum to which I refer.
Playing dead to outwit those who wish me harm.
But it's time to end the charade.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
What charade? For months, I've led the world to believe that my Endframe division was pursuing a broad-based compression platform in direct competition with Pied Piper.
But secretly, I knew that any such platform was destined to fail.
But Pied Piper is not failing.
It's the most popular app in the Hooli store.
One of the most installed, yes.
But I happen to know, because I make it my business to know, that their daily active user numbers are abysmal.
So, you were never developing a platform.
Why didn't you tell us this? Says the chairperson of the board that recently asked for my resignation.
Trust cuts both ways.
I thought it best to leave you out of it.
I'm sorry, Gavin.
I'm just finding all of this impossible to believe.
If you were never building a platform, what did we just spend three-quarters of a billion dollars on? I'm not going to tell you.
Instead, I'm going to let the new head of product for Hooli/Endframe tell you.
Hello, everyone.
I'm Jack Barker, and I'm very excited to introduce Hooli/Endframe's newest product We call it The Box.
GAVIN: Pied Piper's loss is Hooli's gain.
May the best product win.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Can I get you a shirt, sir? There you go.
Actually, let me ask you a question, uh, Emily.
What did you have for breakfast today? - Um, yogurt.
- Okay.
And, uh, we all know what's in yogurt, right? Electrons.
Multivalent states.
Welcome to the Pied Piper Informational Seminar.
Now, what is Pied Piper? Excellent question.
Here it is.
One of your Hooli/Endframe boxes would go right here in this rack.
Okay, let me show you the next location in which we would install one of your boxes.
Congratulations, Jack.
And congratulations to you, Gavin.
- Hey, John? - John? John? A lot of people have raised their hands, uh, throughout this seminar saying, Hey, is thing like the Terminator? Uh, no.
Not at all.
Hi, how big are your files? Dodge Challenger? Hoodie? - JACK: John? - GAVIN: Yo! - JACK: John? - GAVIN: John! - GAVIN: John! - JACK: John! This is Pied Piper, guys.
Okay? If I could just explain it one more time.
Guys? Please don't leave.
I beg you.
Hi, Bernice.
Yeah.
Just look, just look Just look what death gone and done Just look, just look Just look what death gone and done We kind of thought we nailed it with Tables, but you say you want something light, fun, inviting.
But most of all, you want something that delivers a step-by-step guide to all of the nuances of your platform.
Yeah.
All of this with the caveat that you don't have enough money - for even a minuscule ad buy.
- Um, yes, that's right.
That's a pretty small target to hit.
Anyway, here's what we came up with.
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, hello, welcome to Pied Piper.
- How can I help you? - (PIPE TRILLS) What in the name of fuck is that? Well, his name is Pipey, the Pied Piper Piper.
He's fun.
And, uh, you know, the demo's interactive.
Just Looks like you want to compress a movie file! Can I help? You know, with Pied Piper's revolutionary neural network, optimized, sharded data distribution system, it's just six clicks away! Follow me! - I like it.
- That's a fuckin' lie.
Yeah.
So, Richard, you want us to take the most sophisticated and technically complex compression based platform - ever created and add that? - PIPEY: Still here! (PIPE TRILLS) Well, after the booths at CES and South by Southwest, all of our outreach, the Dodge Challenger PIPEY: Still here! Plus, all the cost of working up, you know, this, - we are pretty much all out of money.
- Follow me! Okay.
PIPEY: Uh-oh! Somebody seems confused! Let me walk you through Pied Piper's proprietary peer-to-peer content distribution system, consisting of - I found a new meaning - (KNOCK ON DOOR) JARED: Richard? Are you indisposed? Richard, can I come in? Richard, I'm I'm sorry the guys didn't like Pipey.
It's over, Jared.
Well, you know, a lot of animated characters have rough starts.
Early Bugs Bunny cartoons were just garish displays of anti-Japanese hysteria, and now he's the face of Warner Bros.
I'm not talking about Pipey, Jared.
I'm talking about Pied Piper.
We're dead.
We fought Gavin Belson, Russ, Hooli, the lawsuit, that fucking box, all so we could build our platform the way we wanted to.
And we did, but I guess you just can't fight public opinion, except for one woman named Bernice.
Face it, Jared, being too early is the same as being wrong.
Hey.
- We'll figure it out.
- I don't know if we will.
Besides, I think I'm getting tired of being kicked in the balls.
Come on, we have a few weeks of runway left.
Uh, I don't want to say exactly how much.
Again, I'm not comfortable estimating, but Take what's left of it and divide it up amongst the guys.
I mean, it won't be anywhere close to what you're owed in back pay, but at least it's something.
Don't give up.
Richard, come on, not yet.
We've got to hang on, we've got to see what happens.
Something will turn around.
I know it will.
You really believe that? Absolutely.
Gilfoyle's right, you're you're a terrible liar.
Um, just, uh, set an all-hands for tomorrow at 9 a.
m.
And I'll I'll tell the gang.
It's over, Jared.
And lastly, our deal to furnish Endframe boxes to Maleant Data System Solutions has officially closed, putting us far ahead of even the most optimistic profit targets issued by this very board.
Gavin, it appears we owe you an apology.
We'd like to restore your full status as CEO and chair with a significantly revised bonus and stock options package.
Thank you.
Of course, apology accepted.
I would like nothing more than to move forward in a harmonious and productive manner.
Actually, with that in mind, there's something I'd like to show you.
It's outside.
Is is that all right? A little field trip, if you will? Just down here.
A little farther.
We're almost there.
Just out here, everyone.
Almost there.
Consider the elephant.
Legend has it its memory is so robust it never forgets.
And I assure you, gentlemen of the Hooli board, and lady, neither do I.
(CLEARS THROAT) Okay, guys, uh, we need to have a serious discussion about the future of the company.
(ALL LAUGHING) What? Why is everyone smiling? Richard, something happened last night.
The daily active users are up, way up.
- Look at it.
Look.
- Really? Holy shit! Did we just get 7,000 users in a day? We sure did! We're back! I don't know if it was the outreach or the tutorials, but we seem to be getting traction.
Richard, you pulled us out of a nosedive.
Of course, inevitably, we will run out of fuel and plummet towards the Earth, leaving only a crater behind of torn flesh and excrement, but in the meantime, we are flying high! Yeah.
I guess we are.
You know, it's crazy, just last night I was, uh, telling Jared that I thought we should shut down the company.
Well, perfect timing then, huh? (PHONE RINGS) Uh, excuse me.
I should get this.
Hey, Jared.
- Are those numbers legit? - Of course.
- All right, then.
- This is Jared.
MAN ON PHONE: So, are we happy? Yeah.
Worked out great.
So let's keep the 7,000 users that I bought and add another thousand a day for the next week.
MAN: You got it, buddy.
(MUSIC PLAYS) (BICYCLE BELL RINGS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MAN COUGHS)

******************************************
N/A - The Uptick

1 How the fuck does something like this happen? How does an elephant just die? He was very old and depressed.
He'd recently been rescued from the circus, but as it turns out, he actually really loved performing.
Who gives a fuck about the elephant? What about me? This does not look good.
I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to remove him.
He weighs 9,000 pounds.
Cut it up.
Take it out in pieces.
I I don't mean to interrupt, but but I could call in a personal favor and get a helo crew out of Travis AFB with a Sikorsky Skycrane to airlift it out and drop it in the ocean right after dark.
No muss, no fuss.
There.
Was that so hard, Patrice? Because Hoover sure didn't think so.
I mean, I just found my footing again, and you put me in danger of losing it all over some fucking elephant? Gavin, you always said that here at Hooli, "In order to achieve greatness, we must first achieve goodness.
" Right.
So? So I was a bridesmaid at Sean Parker's wedding when he handed out live bunnies as plush toys.
That wasn't goodness.
It was badness.
And so is this.
You're using endangered animals just to make points at board meetings.
I'm drawing thoughtful, zoological comparisons.
But couldn't you just show them a picture of these animals? A simple Hooli search would yield thousands of choices.
Patrice, I thank you for your honesty, and I will repay you with my own.
I honestly never want to see you in my offices again.
You're fired.
Hoover? - Scramble that Skycrane.
- HOOVER: Yes, sir.
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Please, uh, come in.
Come in.
Have a seat.
I won't take a lot of your time.
I promise.
Okay.
Would you like some tea? I can put a kettle on the hot plate.
Oh, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.
There's no trouble.
You know what? I have a box of of Russell Stover's if the spiders didn't get into 'em.
Jared, is this about the fake users? You know? Two days ago, I wanted to look at user behavior to figure out what spurred the sudden uptick, and, uh, well, I noticed something.
Almost all of our new users were just uploading a single photo into a shared folder, and then the next day, they would take the photo out and then put it back in the day after that and that's it.
You know, just enough to qualify as a daily active user.
Classic click-farm behavior.
And then I remembered our conversation in the bathtub, and it just it had to be you.
Richard, I am so sorry.
It's okay.
Would it make you feel better to to strike me? No.
You you had good intentions, Jared.
Honestly, don't give it another thought.
Just, you know you and I right now are the only ones that know about it.
Okay? And in a few weeks, when we run out of money, this will all be over anyway.
- Richard? - Yes? We have a secret.
Yeah.
ERLICH: I mean, I swear to god, your dicks would have blown out of the back of your assholes if you had been there, hand to God.
Hey, guys.
What's going on? Richard, sit down.
I did it.
I saved the company.
What do you What? How? Jared, have you been crying? Yes, but for ordinary reasons.
- Please, go on.
- ERLICH: Okay.
I was at The Rosewood for lunch.
I mean, it was the lunch hour.
I was there, I wasn't eating, the usual.
So, I walk over to Andreessen and I say something funny, but he stone-faces me.
What did you say? It doesn't matter.
The point is, it was hilarious, but he gave me nothing and neither did his friends.
Then I realized why.
You're not funny? No, Gilfoyle, but that is.
No, it's that everybody thinks Pied Piper is in this death spiral, so it would be inappropriate to laugh at my hysterical joke.
And it hits me.
I know something that they don't.
I know about the uptick.
The uptick? Yes, the uptick! The recent sudden surge in users.
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
That.
Yes, that.
So, while our fortune is rising, everybody else thinks that it's plummeting, and I can use these opposing forces to a multiplying effect like a slingshot, and then I make a decision.
I'm gonna make a move.
So, I say something cryptic about the uptick, and I walk away.
- What did you say? - I don't know.
I can't remember.
But I walk over and I see McNamee's having the short rib, which I hear is delicious but not too heavy, and then I say to him, "You're gonna have to tuck in your tie-dye if you want to eat here.
" (CHUCKLES) - Uh, how's that relevant? - It's not.
But the people that I just walked away from don't know that.
All they know is that I'm over there exchanging witty banter with McNamee, and about what, they don't know.
It's all that they do want to know.
And then, it settles in.
F.
O.
M.
O.
The fear of missing out.
Suddenly, it feels like time is slowing down.
I could see every move I was going to make 12 steps ahead.
It was like I was Bobby Fischer if he could really fuck.
I go outside, I walk across the street to Graylock, I check in on Instagram, Vinod Khosla calls me, asks me what I doing there.
I say, "I can't talk right now.
Call me at Wood Opal.
" Well, he does, and then suddenly Wood Opal is going, "What's Khosla got going on with Bachman?" Meanwhile, I'm taking a leak at a Restoration Hardware.
I jack off a little bit.
I don't cum.
And then it snowballs.
I deftly played Ross Loma against Index Ventures.
And because of that, the big kahuna bites.
Sequoia.
I spend the next 20 minutes denying calls from Jim Goetz, over and over.
And yes, I'm jacking off, but I don't need to ejaculate because by the time I listen to the messages, I've got offers, I've got counters, I've got counter-counters.
I cum.
When the dust settled and the losers went home, all that was left was this.
"Hello, Mr.
Bachman.
"Coleman Blair Partners would like to offer Pied Piper "a Series B round of $6 million on a $60 million valuation.
" Oh.
(QUIETLY) Yeah! Holy shit.
And this asshole wanted to pivot to video chat.
Still valid.
Although less sexy now.
I'll concede that.
It's my Mona Lisa.
And the entire cornerstone upon which I built this motherfucking cathedral that I will forever be remembered for, was this beautiful little uptick.
I think I have a bottle of Cold Duck in the crisper.
Who's drinking? Come on! I got a bottle of Martinelli's for you, Jared.
This is a big day! (CHUCKLES) We did it! Yes! (CHUCKLES) - DINESH: Are there any wine coolers? - I'll talk to him.
I I'll talk to him.
Here's my Hooli badge.
And I have a hanging tag on my rear-view mirror for the parking structure.
Can I just mail that in? No, you need to go get that now.
Okay.
Hey, Dinesh.
I'm just, um, looking for Erlich.
Have you seen him? Oh, he went to the liquor store.
Gotta keep the party going, you know? Oh yeah.
Yeah, Series B.
Crazy, right? - Oh, it's unreal.
- Yeah.
Almost like some of our users.
What? What what does that mean? Oh, "unreal" has so many meanings.
"Fake," "paid for," "one person in Bangladesh pretending to be 6,000.
" Okay.
Um All right, Dinesh, um Oh, no.
I don't want to know a fucking thing.
Okay then.
Great.
I won't tell you anything because nothing happened.
Great.
Okay.
(GASPS) But if something did happen, and we're not saying it did, the fact remains that leaves us in a very advantageous position.
There's a lot of money on the table.
And it would be a shame if that went away.
You know what else would be a shame (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) is if I couldn't find my flash drive.
Gilfoyle, have you seen my flash drive? Right, the one with the zombie script on it? Why yes, the zombie script that randomizes user action in platforms such as Pied Piper.
GILFOYLE: You mean so that fake users and click farms would be absolutely indistinguishable from real users? Oh, I suppose.
I mean, especially during due diligence, like the kind done by VCs or possible future reviews done by certain regulatory bodies.
It also had photos of my auntie.
Anyway, Gilfoyle, have you seen it? I have not.
Mm, well, Richard, keep an eye out for it, will ya? Hey, Gilfoyle, you wanna come inside and help me - Yeah, I think - we're sort of done with the ruse.
- Okay.
Okay, fine.
Well, whatever you did or didn't do, that was serial-killer-level shit.
Agreed.
I think I finally respect you as a CEO.
(DOOR CLOSES) Fuck.
This is fraud.
Is it? I mean, our our platform does exactly what we say it does.
Okay? It's not like we're lying about it like fucking Theranos.
And if our platform works, which we know it will, we will make them billions of dollars.
Everybody wins, Jared.
You still believe that, right? That, if given enough time, the platform will catch on? Richard, don't weaponize my faith in you against me.
Your faith made all this possible.
It's wrong.
Well, every time I try to do the right thing, I get fucked.
And if I do the right thing here, we're done.
That's it.
Doesn't seem like much of an option, does it? (DOOR OPENS) - Deng, they're all just so good.
- (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) RECEPTIONIST: Gavin, CJ Cantwell, line one.
Deng, let's pick this up tomorrow.
(MUSIC STOPS) CJ.
I'm finishing a story I'd love a comment on.
It's about the death of an unpermitted Indian elephant named Maurice in your sculpture garden and its subsequent illegal dumping in the San Francisco Bay.
That's preposterous.
Mm, I have a very good source.
What do you propose we do here? Well, I have one idea.
And what, pray tell, might that be? CJ sold the blog for $2 million.
- No shit.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE) Bachmanity rides again.
Well, not exactly.
Uh, I called Big Head to tell him that our share was worth half a mil each, and, uh, not five minutes later, his father, one Nelson Bighetti, Sr.
, called me and explained that I was never to have any financial dealings with his son in perpetuity, uh, ever or he would get very Italian on me.
And I'm not interested to find out what that means.
Okay.
Shall we? To Coleman Blair! Let's close this fucker.
Good luck, fellas.
(CAR DOOR CLICKS OPEN) - (CAR DOOR CLOSES) - (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Remember, you just sit there and look pretty.
Leave all the talking to me.
And if you mention my Montblanc, then, uh, don't make it overt, like I told you to.
- But do.
- (RICHARD'S PHONE VIBRATES) Uh Hey, what's up? Are you guys out raising money from someone else? Uh, Monica, it's, uh it's kind of a long story.
- Why are you whispering? - Uh Um Oh, my god, you're there right now, aren't you? Jesus! Do you have any idea how big of an asshole you're making me look here? Laurie just lost her shit at me, okay? So, you need to turn around and walk the hell out of there.
Erlich put all this together.
I really had nothing to do with it.
You have everything to do with it.
You're the fucking CEO, Richard! Whatever your company does is 100% on you! Gentlemen.
- They're ready for you.
- Oh.
Yes.
I I gotta go.
Do not hang up on me.
- Richard, do not - (PHONE DISCONNECTS) So listen, we're pumped, guys.
We're thrilled to be getting into Pied Piper right at this inflection point.
It's very exciting.
We are pumped as well.
Aren't we, Richard? - Richard.
- Hm? - Pumped.
- Pumped! - We are pumped up.
- Pumped up.
Mm-hmm.
So we'll just need your John Hancock right here.
Oh, sure, Richard.
Uh, you can use my Montblanc.
Oh.
Uh this is an actual term sheet.
And once I sign this this, that's it, right? - Yup.
No turning back.
- (BOTH CHUCKLE) (CHUCKLES) You can have your lawyers vet the actual stock purchase agreement once we close here just to make sure no one is pulling any funny business.
- (CHUCKLES) No, no.
- No, my lawyer is in jail, so.
So.
Hm.
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my god.
I, uh (CHUCKLES) Wow, I can't believe I didn't think of this before, um, because, well, let me put it to you this way.
What would you say if I told you that the same compression that you know and love is being used in a world-beating, game-changing wait for it video conferencing application? Wouldn't that be interesting? - What? - You mean like Hooli-Chat? This will be far superior to Hooli-Chat.
You may want to fund that instead.
In fact, why don't I, um why don't I just go home, I'll grab my laptop, I'll come back here, I'll show it to you guys.
It's not that far.
I don't mind.
- I'll tell you what, I'll grab an Uber.
- Richard, what - No, no, no, no.
- It's no problem.
- Richard, what the fuck are you doing? - There.
I've ordered it.
Neal is in a blue Kia Sportage and he's right around the corner.
All right, all right.
Look, look, look.
I don't know who else you're talking to about the platform, but I'm willing to go up to seven million on 70.
Okay? But that's it.
You sign this thing right here and right now.
Bravo, Richard.
Nice neg.
Now sign it.
Thank you.
Very generous of you.
I just I just want to make sure that you're aware of all the feedback 'cause we had some focus groups and there were some issues.
Just so you're clear, people have been wondering, "Eh! Where are my files? "Zero K used? Where's the download button? Richard, Richard - The terminator " - All right, all right, you know what? 'Cause it I'm gonna sign it.
Can I sign it? I'll sign it.
You can if you want, but we still need his signature.
Richard, sign it.
That's two years of runway.
- Sign it now! - I can't.
Why the fuck not? Because the numbers are fake.
What? What? What do you mean? - What do you - We bought fake users from a Bangladeshi click farm.
The uptick was fake.
But the the vid chat is real.
Erlich, the fake users were just meant to cheer the guys up.
I had no idea you were gonna take those numbers And what, and go do my fucking job? Pour everything I had into getting the best possible deal for Pied Piper because I believe in them? Well, that's all over now.
Richard, we are fucked! In the amount of time that it took for us to get from that office to right here, every VC in the Valley knows about this.
If I signed those term sheets, I would be committing fraud.
That's a fucking crime! You're saying you wanted me to No, I wanted you to fucking think about that before you paraded me around the whole fucking valley to sell your lie! And then suddenly grew a thick, girthy conscience and fucked me with it.
Are you Richard? - Did you order an Uber? - Oh.
No.
All you had to do was keep your fucking mouth shut and sign that piece of paper.
We would have fixed it afterwards.
But you didn't.
You caked your pants.
No, better yet, you caked my pants.
Fuck you, Richard Hendricks.
Fuck you.
Richard Hendricks, huh? Prick.
- (TIRES SCREECH) - (TIRES SCREECH) (KNOCKING) - Hey.
- Oh, hey, Monica.
Is Richard here? I heard what happened, but he's not answering any of my calls.
We just wanted you to know for the record that we had no idea any of that stuff was going on.
Still trying to wrap our heads around it.
Point is, don't beat yourself up about not seeing it.
I'm not beating myself up I hope you don't think we're guilty by association, because then we would have to think you're guilty by association, which we don't.
Just want to let you know that we would definitely work with you again in the future.
It's good to know.
Guys, thanks.
Um is he in his room? I mean, he said he was.
But I'm gonna go to his room.
- Mm-hmm.
- (PHONE CHIMES) Uh, what's up, Gleb? I hear, uh, Richard shit bed, huh? So, the platform is no goo-oo-oo-oo Fuck, now the vid chat's fucking up.
Odd, considering who wrote the code for it.
Not the code.
The server is overloaded.
How is that possible? We only gave it to like 12 people.
Well, there's a few more than that using it now.
Holy shit.
For what it's worth, Richard, I think you did the right thing.
And I can see now why you didn't want to come to us for funding.
You were trying to protect us.
Yeah.
Well, I really appreciate it.
Uh, Laurie wants out.
Even a whiff of fraud is a mortal sin for VCs.
She needs to wash her hands of any Pied Piper business.
She's forcing a sale.
Fuck.
Yeah, frick.
Yeah.
But it is an open auction, and, you know, between the fraudulent numbers and the real numbers, you guys aren't exactly killing it out there.
So, there is a chance that no one will bid and you might be able to buy back your own company for next to nothing.
That will have to be for literally nothing because we're out of money.
- (CLANG) - Ow! Jesus! Are you okay? Yeah, we're fine.
All right, I spun together a few more servers.
That should handle the traffic.
Look at this.
There are 157 people using it near Gleb.
And 400 people using it near Tara in Boston.
Yeah, I told her to give it to her Satanist friends out there.
Looks like she did.
She knows 400 Satanists in Boston? The Catholic church really did a number on that town.
Hey, Erlich, remember when Gilfoyle said that my video chat app was a piece of shit and that nobody would ever use it? Well, he was wrong.
Over 4,000 times.
Wow, and you developed that with the Pied Piper IP, right? Well, then you can kiss that goodbye.
Oh, fuck.
Speaking of, I'm actually using the first dollars of my blog windfall on a trip to Kainchi Dham Ashram in Nainital, India, where Steve Jobs famously sought peace and came up with the idea for a little product called the Lisa.
Good luck.
(RICHARD'S DOOR OPENS) Richard, I'll expect you off the premises by end of day.
Monica.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.
You know, you can stay here for one year.
Free rent.
ERLICH: Jian-Yang! GAVIN: Laurie! Ah.
Gavin.
You know Jack, of course.
That is correct.
Um, Gavin, can we address the elephant in the room? - Sorry? - Pied Piper.
Right.
Yes, of course.
(CLEARS THROAT) I am forcing a sale.
Your Maleant dealings demonstrate that you're still pursuing a middle-out.
Might you be interested in placing a bid? Why would he want to bail out Raviga? You said it yourself, our compression play is thriving.
Fair enough.
You know what? I'm a completionist.
Even if I buy it just to throw it in the garbage, I'd like to be the one to drive the final nail in the Hendricks coffin.
I'll give you $900 for it? - (JACK CHUCKLES) - I believe that is a joke.
You know what? I like nice, round numbers.
Make it a million? A million dollars? Gavin Belson gets to buy Pied Piper for $1 million and Raviga gets all of it because of their liquidation preference and I get jack shit? Is that what you're telling me? Goddamn it.
I know this is the last way that you wanted it to end.
I'm really sorry.
Yeah, well, I I'll see you at the meeting.
- (COMPUTER BEEPS) - Is that Hooli-Chat? They fix it or something? - That didn't look shitty at all.
- Actually, it's it's ours.
Um, the guys hacked it together.
I can send you an invite if you want.
Yeah.
Cool.
Thanks.
We got up to 4K users totally organically.
Oh.
- (COMPUTER BEEPS) - Oh, shit! 7K now.
Wow, we should have been focusing on this instead.
Not that it matters.
I mean, it's all gonna be property of Gavin Belson in an hour, so.
That's ironic, huh? N no, for real, I'm asking.
Is it? I don't know.
I was just smiling.
Feels ironic.
Hey, uh, so thank you for, uh letting me stay here.
No worries.
Steve says you're welcome to take my spot on the couch until you can find a job and get your own place.
Thanks.
So, uh, when's your dad coming to pick you up? Uh, a couple of hours I guess.
Then we're turning right around and going back to Phoenix.
You know, he said he wants to be able to keep an eye on me and my money and that I need to get a real job to learn the value of a of a hard day's night or something like that.
Well, um, I should probably get going to this board meeting.
Um, and you're probably gonna be gone when I'm back, so - guess this is it.
- Yeah, I guess so.
See ya.
- Oh - Oh - Okay.
- Okay.
- All right.
Cool, man.
- There we go.
Richard, e even though it's the last board meeting and and essentially meaningless, thank you for letting me be a part of it.
It's an honor.
Okay, you don't have to keep saying that.
(DOOR OPENS) Good day, all.
This should be brief.
The only item on the agenda is, of course, the authorization of the sale of Pied Piper to the current high bidder.
Three "yes" votes will approve the sale.
And as Raviga controls three of the board seats, - it seems - I'm sorry.
I - I'm not doing it.
- Oh, Monica, not again.
I'm sorry, but look, Richard has worked too hard and I know that I can't stop it, but I'm not gonna vote to let Pied Piper become the property of that asshole.
Monica, I also happen to find him contemptible.
But Pied Piper will be sold to the high bidder, period.
You know what? I don't care.
You want to fire me, fire me.
If we're not gonna adhere to the values that Peter Gregory instilled, then I don't think I belong here.
Monica, you don't have to do this.
I'm not voting yes.
Very well.
You're off the board.
Excuse me! Man! - Do you work here? - Well, it was my first day actually.
- Everybody's been super ni - Sit.
You are now officially on the board of directors of Pied Piper.
Oh, okay.
That's fine I guess.
When I point to you, you will vote yes.
Now, I move to vote on the sale of Pied Piper.
I vote yes.
I vote yes.
And Evan.
Evan? I can't do it.
What? Why? Because Monica? I love you.
There.
I said it.
And I could never do anything to make you sad.
Oh, for fuck's sake! Do I have to pull the receptionist in here? How does this compare with a typical board meeting? All right, stop.
Everybody, just stop.
We all know how this is gonna go, so let's just get it over with.
All right? Um, I vote yes.
There.
Okay? I approve the sale.
Three "yes" votes.
Can this please just be done? Very well.
- I vote yes also.
- Irrelevant.
But thank you.
The sale is approved.
Pied Piper, its IP, and all of its assets are now officially the property of Bachmanity, LLC.
Wait, sorry, did did you just say "Bachmanity"? As in Erlich Bachman and Nelson Bighetti? Yes, you know them.
They wait, they they had the highest bid? I received a telephone call approximately 30 minutes ago entering a bid of one million and one dollars with a firm no-shop clause.
So when you were referring to the person who bought Pied Piper as a contemptible asshole, you were talking about Erlich? To which contemptible asshole did you think I was referring? Gavin Belson.
Oh.
I see.
No.
This meeting is adjourned.
I thank you all for your time.
(CHUCKLES) So Bachmanity it is.
(ALL CHUCKLE) That's good.
So should we give this thing a shot? (DOOR CLOSES) You and Big Head, huh? Um sorry you had to cancel your trip.
And look, I I really appreciate all this.
I really think this video chat thing is gonna be something, you know? I don't know if you've seen the numbers.
You want a number? The percentage I give a fuck about you, zero.
It's trending steady.
And of course I've seen the numbers.
This is a business opportunity.
Nothing more.
Big Head was your friend.
He was the one that, uh, talked me into it.
I don't trust you, Richard Hendricks.
And it's gonna take a long, long, long time to regain my trust.
Are we clear? Are we absolutely clear? PEOPLE: (CHANTING) Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! Always blue! - Always blue! Alway - Aah! (ALL GROAN) - GILFOYLE: You suck.
- (PHONE CHIMES) Oh, fuck, it's my dad again.
He's gotta be so pissed.
I can't believe this is happening, you guys.
I mean, I guess now we're a video chat company, but the best part of it is it's us, you know? Just us controlling our own destiny.
No, the best part of it is I own 50%.
- (ERLICH CHUCKLES) - RICHARD: Well, yes, um, you and Big Head do own the entire company, but I am the founder, it's my algorithm, so I'm assuming I'm getting my original shares back, right? Why would you assume that? Well, when a tech company reboots, it's normal to have a a conversation about restructuring the cap table.
Good, 'cause I'm the guy that hacked together the video chat app to see if that woman was hot, so Yeah, but it's not gonna scale until I get in there and scrape all the Dinesh off.
Well, Laurie still hasn't called me back, so I may need a new job.
And I'm assuming Pied Piper can't afford my salary, so I'll need stock.
Do we really want it to be called Pied Piper anymore? No, yes.
Of cour of of course we want Why do we want to change the name? It's great.
Yeah, and we do already have the jackets.
Big.
Head.
(ERLICH'S PHONE CHIMES) Big Head.
Go for Erlich.
Erlich Bachman, this is you as an old man.
I'm ugly and I'm dead.
Alone.
I'm gonna let him have this one.
All right, uh well, I'm sorry to hear that, Future Me.
What a terrible thing.
I'll talk to you in several years.
DINESH: You're up.
